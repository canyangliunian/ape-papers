No fatal errors found in the draft under the four requested checks.

- **Data–Design Alignment:** Treatment timing (1906) is between the two census waves used (1900 pre, 1910 post). Post-treatment observations exist. Treatment definition (SF county treated; LA County and King County controls) is used consistently across the design and tables.
- **Regression Sanity:** All reported coefficients, standard errors, R², and sample sizes are numerically plausible (no impossible values; no explosive SEs; no NA/Inf/NaN).
- **Completeness:** Regression tables report **N** and **SEs**; figures/tables referenced in the text appear to exist in the provided draft; no placeholders (TBD/XXX/NA) detected.
- **Internal Consistency:** Key headline magnitudes in the abstract match the corresponding DiD interaction terms shown (Male: 0.074 in Table 2; OCCSCORE: −1.658 in Table 3; Foreign-born: −0.026 in Table 4). Treatment timing is consistently 1906 with 1910 as post.
