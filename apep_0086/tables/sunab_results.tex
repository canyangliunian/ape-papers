\item \textit{Notes:} Unweighted average of post-treatment event-study coefficients
($e = 0$ through $e = +10$) from the \citet{sunandabraham2021} interaction-weighted
estimator, estimated via \texttt{fixest::sunab()} with state and year fixed effects.
The reference period is $e = -1$. Standard error computed via the delta method
using the clustered variance-covariance matrix. This simple average is reported as a
descriptive summary; it is not a formally aggregated ATT.
