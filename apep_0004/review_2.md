## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix): FAIL**  
   - The manuscript shows pages numbered **1–25**, with **References starting on p. 24**.  
   - That implies **~23 pages of main text** (pp. 1–23) **excluding references**, which is **below the 25-page minimum**.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography): PASS**  
   - Bibliography contains **~23 references** (well above 15).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet-point sections in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): PASS**  
   - The Introduction, Background/Literature, Results, and Discussion are written in full paragraphs (no bullet formatting observed).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs): PASS**  
   - Introduction: clearly ≥ 4 paragraphs.  
   - Literature/Background: multiple substantive paragraphs across 2.1–2.3.  
   - Data/Methods: multiple substantive paragraphs across 3.1–3.5.  
   - Results: multiple substantive paragraphs across 4.1–4.4.  
   - Conclusion: appears to have ~3–4 substantive paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all figures show visible data; not broken/empty): PASS**  
   - Figure 1 (event study) displays plotted coefficients with axes and values; not empty/broken.

6. **Tables (all tables have real numbers; no placeholders): PASS**  
   - Tables 1–3 contain numerical estimates and standard errors; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before Phase 2 content review
- **Paper is too short**: Main text is **~23 pages**, but requirement is **≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix**.  
  - You need to add **at least ~2+ pages** of substantive main-text material (not references), e.g., additional robustness checks, alternative specifications (e.g., synthetic control), inference strategy with few clusters (e.g., randomization inference / wild cluster bootstrap), sensitivity to 2020 handling, expanded heterogeneity, or additional outcomes.

(Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until the length requirement is met.)
