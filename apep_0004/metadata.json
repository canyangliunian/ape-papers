  "abstract": "Using a difference-in-differences design comparing Hawaii to control states from 2015-2022, this paper finds no evidence that Hawaii's Kupuna Caregivers Program increased labor force participation among adults in multigenerational households. The null results are most plausibly explained by the program's small scale precluding detectable population-level effects."
