## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix): FAIL**  
   - Approximate pagination in the manuscript: Introduction starts p.5; Conclusion ends p.23; References begin p.24; Appendix begins p.26.  
   - That implies **main text ≈ p.5–23 = ~19 pages**, excluding references/appendix. This is **below 25 pages**.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography): FAIL**  
   - The bibliography lists **~10 references** (CDC; Czernich et al.; Dettling et al.; Fairlie & Robinson; IJMAR; Kolko; Pew; Twenge et al.; Vigdor et al.; Virginia DHCD).  
   - This is **below 15**.

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): FAIL**  
   - Multiple sections use **bulleted lists** rather than paragraph prose, including:
     - **Institutional Background (3.1)** (“Key features…: • Scale • Targeting …”)  
     - **Results/Discussion** contain bullet-pointed interpretations of findings (e.g., “• Screen time increased…”, etc.).  
   - Requirement says **if ANY of these sections use bullet points, FAIL**.

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs): FAIL**  
   - Several major sections are too thin in paragraph form (even aside from bullet formatting). Examples:
     - **Literature Review (Section 2)**: each subsection is ~1 paragraph; overall feels too brief for “3–4 substantive paragraphs” per major section under a top-journal standard.  
     - **Conclusion (Section 8)**: appears to be ~2 paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data): PASS**  
   - The included figures (gender bar chart; event-study panels; stacked time composition) show visible plotted data and labeled axes.

6. **Tables (no placeholders; real numbers): PASS**  
   - Tables shown (summary statistics, DiD results, heterogeneity, event-study coefficients, codes/FIPS) contain numeric entries (not “TBD/XXX”).

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Increase main-text length** to **≥ 25 pages excluding references and appendix** (currently ~19 pages).  
2. **Expand bibliography** to **≥ 15 references** (currently ~10).  
3. **Convert bullet lists to full paragraph prose** in **Introduction/Literature/Results/Discussion** (and ideally throughout).  
4. **Expand underdeveloped sections** so each major section (Intro, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion) has **3–4 substantive paragraphs** in narrative form (not bullets).

Per your instructions, I’m **not proceeding to Phase 2 (content review)** until Phase 1 passes.
