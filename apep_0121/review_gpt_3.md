## Referee Report: “State Minimum Wage Increases and Young Adult Household Formation: Evidence from Staggered Adoption” (January 30, 2026)

### Summary (for the editor)
The paper asks an important, policy-relevant question—whether state minimum-wage increases enable young adults to form independent households—and uses modern staggered-adoption DiD (Callaway–Sant’Anna) on a 51-jurisdiction panel (2015–2019, 2021–2022). The headline result is a precisely-estimated null at the state-year aggregate level (ATT ≈ −0.54pp on parental co-residence; SE ≈ 0.45). The econometrics are broadly competent and the paper clears the “no fatal DiD errors” bar.

However, for a top general-interest journal (AER/QJE/JPE/ReStud/Ecta or AEJ:EP), the current design is not yet convincing as a *credible causal estimate of a well-defined estimand with interpretable external validity*. The main limitation is that the outcome and treatment are measured at too aggregated a level (state-year), producing severe exposure dilution and likely non-classical measurement issues, while policy timing is plausibly endogenous to time-varying state conditions and policy bundles. The “null” is therefore difficult to interpret as evidence of no meaningful effect on the *treated population* (low-wage young adults). The paper needs a sharper estimand, a stronger research design (or stronger diagnostics/robustness to policy endogeneity), and a more compelling contribution relative to existing minimum-wage and household-formation literatures.

# 1. FORMAT CHECK

**Length**
- The document appears to be ~48 pages including appendices/tables/figures (page numbers visible up to at least 48). Main text looks ~35 pages (through Conclusion), so it clears the ≥25 page threshold.

**References**
- The bibliography covers core minimum wage papers and core staggered DiD methodology (Callaway–Sant’Anna; Sun–Abraham; Goodman-Bacon; de Chaisemartin–D’Haultfœuille; Rambachan–Roth; Borusyak–Jaravel–Spiess).
- But it is missing several closely related literatures on (i) minimum wages and prices/rents/cost of living; (ii) minimum wages and household structure/family formation; (iii) housing affordability and household formation in the U.S. context; (iv) practical DiD guidance and inference issues in panels with few clusters and staggered timing (details in Section 4 below).

**Prose (paragraphs vs bullets)**
- Major sections (Introduction, Results, Discussion) are written in paragraphs (e.g., pp. 2–5, 16–33). Bullet points are mostly used for variable definitions and robustness lists (Section 4, Section 7), which is acceptable.

**Section depth**
- Introduction: clearly 3+ substantive paragraphs (pp. 2–5).
- Institutional background and conceptual framework: multiple paragraphs (pp. 5–8).
- Data/Empirics: multiple paragraphs plus definitions (pp. 8–15).
- Results/Robustness/Discussion: multiple paragraphs (pp. 16–33).
- This passes the “depth” heuristic.

**Figures**
- Figures shown (treatment rollout; raw trends; event study; Bacon; control-group comparison) have axes and visible data (pp. 16–25; images included). Titles/notes generally adequate.
- Some figures use small fonts and heavy confidence bands; ensure publication-legible font sizes and consistent y-axis scaling across comparable event-study panels.

**Tables**
- Tables contain real numbers and SEs (Tables 1–6 etc.). No placeholders.

**Format/presentation issues to flag**
1. The “Acknowledgements” and “Generated by Claude” statements (p. 35) are not standard for top journals and raise immediate concerns about authorship, replicability, and responsibility for analysis choices. At minimum, the paper must have a standard authorship statement, and a clear replication package with human accountability.
2. Some claims are stated too strongly given limitations (e.g., “does not produce detectable shifts” is fine; but parts read like “no effect” without sufficient caveats about dilution/exposure and policy endogeneity—see Discussion, pp. 31–33).

---

# 2. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY (CRITICAL)

### a) Standard Errors
- **PASS.** Main coefficients are reported with SEs in parentheses (e.g., Table 2, p. 19; Table 3, p. 20; Table 5, p. 27). Dynamic effects have SEs and 95% CIs.

### b) Significance Testing
- **PASS.** The paper conducts inference via clustered bootstrap SEs (state-level clusters) and reports significance and/or CIs.

### c) Confidence Intervals
- **PASS.** 95% CIs are reported for main effects (e.g., Table 3 includes CIs; text reports CI for ATT around p. 3–4 and p. 19).

### d) Sample Sizes
- **PASS.** N is reported for key regressions (e.g., Table 2; Table 5). The panel is 357 state-years.

### e) DiD with staggered adoption
- **PASS (method), but with interpretability caveats.**
  - The paper appropriately uses Callaway–Sant’Anna (2021) and also reports Sun–Abraham and TWFE as comparisons (Section 5, pp. 13–15; Table 2, p. 19).
  - It correctly notes that early cohorts are “always-treated” within the panel and do not contribute to the CS-DiD estimand (Section 4.2, pp. 9–10; Appendix Table 7, p. 41).

### f) RDD
- Not applicable.

### Inference concerns that still need attention (even though it “passes”)
1. **Small number of treated cohorts contributing to ATT**: only 16 treated states contribute to CS-DiD (cohorts 2016–2021). Inference with 51 clusters is usually workable, but *effective identifying variation* is smaller. You should:
   - Report influence/leave-one-out diagnostics at the cohort and state level (are results driven by a few states?).
   - Consider wild cluster bootstrap-t for robustness (Cameron, Gelbach & Miller 2008 is cited, but the implementation is not clearly described beyond “clustered bootstrap”).
2. **Outcome is an ACS estimate with sampling error**: State-year ACS one-year estimates can be noisy, and the sampling variance differs across states. Treating these as error-free outcomes can attenuate estimates and distort SEs. Consider:
   - Weighting by the inverse of ACS variance (or at least population weights), and/or using MOEs to propagate measurement uncertainty.
   - Showing robustness to population weighting versus unweighted state averages (Figures appear unweighted, e.g., Figure 2 note).

**Bottom line on methodology:** Not unpublishable on inference grounds; it meets minimum standards. The bigger issues are identification/estimand and substantive contribution.

# 3. IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY

### Credibility
The basic idea—staggered adoption of higher minimum wages—is standard, and CS-DiD is appropriate. But the **identification story is not yet credible enough for a top journal** because:

1. **Policy timing endogeneity and policy bundling** (Section 5.5, p. 15 acknowledges but does not resolve):
   - States raising minimum wages likely differ in *time-varying* ways (housing market tightness, migration, urbanization trends, EITC expansions, housing policies, minimum wage indexing, political shifts).
   - State and year FE do not solve time-varying confounding.
   - The unemployment “balance test” (p. 15) is not sufficient; unemployment is only one proxy and may itself be affected by minimum wages.

2. **Severe treatment mismeasurement / heterogeneity**
   - “Effective minimum wage” at the state-year level ignores: local minimum wages (Seattle, SF, NYC), coverage differences, tipped minimum wages, enforcement, and indexing.
   - Mid-year changes are collapsed to “predominant rate,” which introduces timing error and attenuates dynamic effects.

3. **Outcome mismeasurement and weak link to the decision margin**
   - ACS Table B09021 “child of householder” undercounts parental co-residence when the parent is not the householder (Section 4.1, p. 9 notes this, but the consequences are not quantified).
   - Household formation is a micro decision. State-level shares average over a huge mass of unaffected 18–34-year-olds (college students, high earners). This is not merely a power issue; it changes the estimand into “effect on the average 18–34-year-old,” which is not the policy-relevant target.

### Assumptions and diagnostics
- The paper discusses parallel trends and no anticipation (Section 5.4, pp. 14–15).
- It provides an event study (Table 3/Figure 3, pp. 20–22) and finds no pre-trend violations in CS-DiD (though a joint test p=0.101 is borderline; Section 7.7).
- Sun–Abraham shows significant pre-trends (Table 4, p. 26), which the paper partially dismisses. For a top journal, this needs deeper investigation, not a footnote-level caveat. At minimum:
  - Re-estimate Sun–Abraham restricting the control group to never-treated only (to match CS-DiD’s identifying comparison).
  - Show that pre-trends disappear with consistent comparison sets, or explain why they do not.

### Placebos and robustness
You do several robustness checks (thresholds; control group; excluding 2021; alternative outcomes). That is good but not sufficient for the main threat: **endogenous timing and policy bundles**. Missing/needed:
- **Placebo outcomes**: e.g., parental co-residence for older groups (35–49), or outcomes unlikely to respond to minimum wage changes.
- **Negative control treatments**: e.g., pseudo adoption years among never-treated states.
- **Border or sub-state designs** to mitigate unobserved state-level confounding (see suggestions below).

### Do conclusions follow?
- The paper generally phrases results as “no detectable shifts” and acknowledges dilution and inability to rule out subgroup effects (Abstract and Discussion). That is appropriate.
- But some parts still imply a stronger “no effect” interpretation than the design warrants, given confounding and treatment/outcome measurement limits.

# 4. LITERATURE (missing references + BibTeX)

## What’s good
- Minimum wage core: Card & Krueger; Dube et al.; Cengiz et al.; Neumark & Wascher; Manning.
- Household formation: Kaplan (moving back home); Dettling & Hsu; Mykyta & Macartney; Haurin et al.
- DiD methods: CS; SA; Bacon; dCDH; Rambachan–Roth; Borusyak–Jaravel–Spiess.

## Key missing literatures to cite (and why)

### (i) Minimum wage and prices / local cost of living (beyond one rent paper)
You cite Yamaguchi (2020) unpublished. You need to engage the broader “minimum wage → prices” literature, because your mechanism discussion relies heavily on rent/cost offsets.

```bibtex
@article{Aaronson2001Prices,
  author  = {Aaronson, Daniel},
  title   = {Price Pass-Through and the Minimum Wage},
  journal = {Review of Economics and Statistics},
  year    = {2001},
  volume  = {83},
  number  = {1},
  pages   = {158--169}
}
```

```bibtex
@article{MacDonaldNilsson2016,
  author  = {MacDonald, James M. and Nilsson, Johan},
  title   = {The Effects of Increasing the Minimum Wage on Prices: Analyzing the Incidence of Policy Design and Context},
  journal = {Economics Letters},
  year    = {2016},
  volume  = {148},
  pages   = {67--71}
}
```

(If you prefer higher-profile citations, include a more recent survey on minimum wages and prices; at minimum, acknowledge that rent is only one component of living costs and that price pass-through evidence is mixed.)

### (ii) Minimum wage and family/household structure
There is related work on minimum wages and marriage/fertility/household structure; even if not directly about “living with parents,” it is the adjacent literature your paper belongs in.

```bibtex
@article{Neumark2004Family,
  author  = {Neumark, David and Wascher, William},
  title   = {Minimum Wages, Labor Market Institutions, and Youth Employment: A Cross-National Analysis},
  journal = {Industrial and Labor Relations Review},
  year    = {2004},
  volume  = {57},
  number  = {2},
  pages   = {223--248}
}
```

(This is not exactly household formation; if you can locate a closer paper on minimum wages and marriage/fertility/household composition, that would be preferable. Right now the household-formation link is under-cited.)

### (iii) Housing affordability and household formation (U.S.)
You cite Ermisch (UK) and a few U.S. recession papers, but top-journal readers will expect key U.S. housing affordability references and/or empirical household formation under housing supply constraints.

```bibtex
@article{GlaeserGyourko2005,
  author  = {Glaeser, Edward L. and Gyourko, Joseph},
  title   = {Urban Decline and Durable Housing},
  journal = {Journal of Political Economy},
  year    = {2005},
  volume  = {113},
  number  = {2},
  pages   = {345--375}
}
```

```bibtex
@article{Saiz2010,
  author  = {Saiz, Albert},
  title   = {The Geographic Determinants of Housing Supply},
  journal = {Quarterly Journal of Economics},
  year    = {2010},
  volume  = {125},
  number  = {3},
  pages   = {1253--1296}
}
```

These help you formalize and test the “rent offset depends on supply elasticity” mechanism you mention (Prediction 4).

### (iv) DiD practice and inference with staggered timing (applied guidance)
You cite Roth et al. (2023) and Wooldridge (2021). Good. But given your inference and pre-trend discussion, you should also cite applied DiD guidance / warnings about two-way FE and inference.

```bibtex
@article{BertrandDufloMullainathan2004,
  author  = {Bertrand, Marianne and Duflo, Esther and Mullainathan, Sendhil},
  title   = {How Much Should We Trust Differences-in-Differences Estimates?},
  journal = {Quarterly Journal of Economics},
  year    = {2004},
  volume  = {119},
  number  = {1},
  pages   = {249--275}
}
```

Also consider citing more explicit discussions of event-study pre-trends and interpretation (beyond Rambachan–Roth), especially since Sun–Abraham shows pre-trend issues in your implementation.

# 5. WRITING QUALITY (CRITICAL)

### a) Prose vs bullets
- **PASS.** The paper is mostly in paragraph form. Bullet lists are used mainly for variable definitions and robustness summaries (Sections 4 and 7), which is acceptable.

### b) Narrative flow
- The Introduction (pp. 2–5) does a good job motivating the question and positioning it between labor and demography/housing.
- However, the paper’s arc becomes repetitive after the main null result: many subsections restate “null, robust, null” without adding new economic content. For a top journal, the paper needs either:
  1) a sharper estimand (effects on exposed young adults), or  
  2) a deeper mechanism/heterogeneity exercise (housing supply elasticity; local rents; wage “bite”),  
  otherwise the narrative risks reading like a careful technical report documenting a null.

### c) Sentence quality
- Generally clear and grammatically correct, but somewhat formulaic. The Results/Robustness sections could be tightened substantially. Many paragraphs begin with “This null result…” or “The findings suggest…”; vary structure and push key economic interpretation earlier.

### d) Accessibility
- Technical terms are usually defined (CS-DiD, TWFE issues). Good.
- Magnitudes are contextualized (e.g., −0.54pp on base 30.76%). Good.

### e) Figures/tables
- Mostly self-explanatory with notes.
- But for a top journal: improve figure legibility, unify styling, and ensure that event-study confidence intervals are interpretable (pointwise vs uniform bands should be stated; you currently state pointwise).

# 6. CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS (to make it publishable at a top journal)

## A. Redefine the estimand to match the policy question
Right now the estimand is: effect on the *average* 18–34-year-old in a state-year. That is not the relevant target if only a minority are exposed. You need to either:
1. **Move to microdata** (ACS PUMS) and estimate effects for likely-exposed groups:
   - low education (HS or some college),
   - low predicted wage / low occupation wage bins,
   - service-sector workers,
   - renters vs non-renters,
   - non-students.
2. Or construct a **shift-share / “bite” design** at the state-year level:
   - interact treatment with baseline share of young adults earning near the minimum wage (from CPS/ACS micro),
   - estimate heterogeneous effects by “bite” (standard in minimum wage literature).

This would convert “dilution” from an ex post excuse into an explicit design feature.

## B. Strengthen identification against endogenous timing
At minimum:
- Add **state-specific linear trends** as a sensitivity check (with caution; but reviewers will ask).
- Include **region-by-year fixed effects** to absorb differential regional shocks (especially since you find a “South” effect).
Better:
- Use a **border-county design** (Dube, Lester & Reich 2010 style), or commuting-zone design, with local housing outcomes and living arrangements. Household formation plausibly varies more within-state than across-state.
- Alternatively, use **synthetic control / augmented synthetic control** for key adoption cohorts to demonstrate parallel trends more credibly.

## C. Improve treatment measurement
- Incorporate local minimum wages where feasible (at least as a robustness / measurement error discussion with data).
- Handle mid-year changes using an “effective annualized minimum wage” (hours-weighted share of year at each rate), rather than “predominant rate.”

## D. Address ACS measurement error explicitly
- Use ACS margins of error (MOE) to build state-year outcome variances.
- Report robustness to weighting by population and/or inverse variance.
- Consider whether the dependent variable is bounded [0,100] and whether linear models are appropriate (likely fine, but show robustness with fractional response or log-odds).

## E. Clarify and deepen the mechanism tests
You propose the rent-offset mechanism (Section 3; Section 7.6). But the heterogeneity analysis is too coarse (Census region). For a serious mechanism test:
- Interact treatment with **housing supply elasticity** (Saiz 2010) or land-use regulation indices.
- Interact with **baseline rent levels** or rent-to-income ratios for young adults.
- If possible, examine **state-year rents for young renters** using microdata, not median rent overall.

## F. Reconcile Sun–Abraham pre-trends
You cannot leave significant SA pre-trends as “weighting differences.” Do:
- SA with never-treated controls only, or
- show cohort-specific pre-trends and diagnose which cohorts generate violations,
- adjust event-time window/bins to ensure common support.

## G. Make the contribution sharper
A top journal will ask: “What do we learn beyond ‘no aggregate effect’?” You need at least one of:
- A credible exposed-subsample effect (even if small),
- A mechanism decomposition (income vs rents),
- A design improvement that makes the causal claim more believable than state-year FE.

---

# 7. OVERALL ASSESSMENT

## Key strengths
- Important question bridging labor policy and demographic/housing outcomes.
- Uses appropriate modern staggered-adoption DiD methods (CS-DiD) and reports event studies, robustness, and clear magnitudes.
- Transparent about “always-treated” cohorts and panel limitations (Section 4.2; Appendix Table 7).

## Critical weaknesses (top-journal level)
1. **Weak policy-relevant estimand due to exposure dilution**: state-year aggregate shares of all 18–34-year-olds are too blunt to detect or interpret effects on minimum-wage-exposed young adults.
2. **Identification threatened by endogenous timing and correlated policy bundles**: current robustness does not convincingly address this.
3. **Treatment/outcome measurement concerns**: local MWs ignored; ACS aggregation and “child of householder” definition; sampling error in ACS outcomes.
4. **Mechanism analysis underdeveloped**: “rent offset” is asserted but not tested rigorously.
5. **Sun–Abraham pre-trends unresolved**: needs deeper diagnosis.

## Specific improvements
- Move to microdata or “bite” heterogeneity; strengthen identification (border/sub-state; region-year FE); correct treatment timing; incorporate local MWs; address ACS measurement error; deepen mechanism tests with housing supply elasticity.

DECISION: MAJOR REVISION
