# Internal Review - Round 1

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Paper:** Do Data Privacy Laws Stimulate Entrepreneurship? Evidence from State Comprehensive Privacy Legislation

## Format Check

- **Length:** 28 pages of main text (excluding appendix), exceeds 25-page minimum
- **References:** Adequate coverage of methodology (Callaway & Sant'Anna, Goodman-Bacon, Sun & Abraham) and policy literature (Goldfarb & Tucker, Jia et al., Johnson et al.)
- **Prose:** All major sections in paragraph form, no bullet points in introduction, results, or discussion
- **Section depth:** Each section has 3+ substantive paragraphs
- **Figures:** All three figures display data with proper axes and legends
- **Tables:** All tables contain real numbers with standard errors

## Statistical Methodology

- **Standard Errors:** All coefficients reported with SEs in parentheses
- **Significance Testing:** p-values and significance stars reported
- **Confidence Intervals:** 95% CIs reported for main results
- **Sample Sizes:** N reported in all tables (4,410 observations)
- **DiD Methodology:** Uses Callaway-Sant'Anna with never-treated controls - PASS

## Identification Strategy

- Parallel trends assumption discussed extensively
- Pre-trend test reported (p = 0.999)
- Robustness checks include leave-one-out, wild bootstrap, alternative estimators
- Limitations section is comprehensive
- California excluded due to COVID confounding - appropriate

## Literature

Literature coverage is adequate. Could add:
- Campbell et al. (2015) on GDPR effects
- Chiou & Tucker (2017) on privacy concerns
- Miller & Tucker (2009) on health privacy

## Writing Quality

- Clear narrative flow from motivation to findings
- Accessible to non-specialists
- Active voice preferred
- Figures and tables are publication-quality

## Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Novel finding (positive effect of privacy laws on business formation)
- Rigorous methodology (CS-DiD)
- Strong parallel trends evidence
- Comprehensive robustness checks

**Weaknesses:**
- Texas/Oregon outlier (ATT = 964) needs more discussion
- Short post-treatment periods for 2025 cohorts
- Cannot distinguish mechanisms

**DECISION: MINOR REVISION**
