# Internal Review - Round 2

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Paper:** Do Data Privacy Laws Stimulate Entrepreneurship? Evidence from State Comprehensive Privacy Legislation

## Summary

Paper has been revised based on Round 1 feedback. Main issues addressed:
- Advisor reviews (both GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3-Flash) now PASS
- All internal consistency issues fixed
- Figures render correctly
- CIs computed consistently using 1.96×SE

## Remaining Issues (Minor)

1. **Mechanisms section:** Could benefit from more specificity on which mechanism is most likely
2. **External validity:** Limited discussion of whether effects generalize beyond U.S.

## Writing Quality

Prose is clear and accessible. The paper tells a compelling story about the surprising positive effects of privacy regulation on entrepreneurship.

## Overall Assessment

The paper is methodologically sound with strong identification. The finding that privacy laws increase business formation (contrary to compliance cost hypothesis) is novel and policy-relevant.

**DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT**

Conditional on:
1. Adding a brief discussion of external validity
2. Minor copyediting

The paper is ready for external review.
