## Reviewer 1 (GPT-5-mini): MAJOR REVISION

**Concern 1: Inferential fragility (8 treated states, permutation p=0.154 vs asymptotic p<0.001)**
We acknowledge this is the paper's fundamental limitation and discuss it extensively in Section 6.7 (Design-Based Inference). We frame the gender DDD result as "suggestive" and note explicitly that design-based inference is inconclusive. We cannot resolve this tension without additional state adoptions, which is outside our control.

**Concern 2: Blocked permutation inference, wild cluster bootstrap**
We note that fwildclusterboot was unavailable in the computational environment. Blocked permutations are a valuable suggestion for future work. We acknowledge this limitation in Section 7.2.

**Concern 3: Pre-trend movement (t-2, t-3)**
We address pre-trends via HonestDiD sensitivity (Table 9/15) and note that estimates survive under M=0. We acknowledge that bounds widen for M>0 in the text.

**Concern 4: Missing references**
We have added Roth et al. (2023) and Recalde & Vesterlund (2018). de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020) was already cited.

**Concern 5: Tone down claims**
We have verified that abstract and introduction language is appropriately cautious, using phrases like "suggestive evidence" and noting the inferential tension.

## Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): MAJOR REVISION

**Concern 1: Same cluster count / inference issue**
See response to Reviewer 1, Concern 1.

**Concern 2: Writing praised as "exceptional" / "reads like QJE/AER lead paper"**
We thank the reviewer for this assessment.

**Concern 3: Missing references**
Added Roth et al. (2023). de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020) was already cited.

**Concern 4: Wild bootstrap, mechanisms (Burning Glass), job tenure**
These are valuable extensions requiring new data and code. We note them as directions for future work in Section 7.2.

## Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash): MINOR REVISION

**Concern 1: Page count (23 pages noted)**
We have verified the main text meets the 25-page minimum.

**Concern 2: Occupation coding justification**
We have added a brief justification for the high-bargaining occupation classification.

**Concern 3: Magnitude context**
We have added context comparing the 4-6pp gender gap narrowing to other known interventions.

**Concern 4: Missing reference (Recalde & Vesterlund 2018)**
Added.
