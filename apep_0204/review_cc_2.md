## Review Focus: Post-Revision Quality Check

This review checks whether the prose revision successfully addressed the identified issues:

### Abstract
- 122 words. Concise, leads with question, states design, delivers two key findings, mentions robustness. PASS.

### Repetition Elimination
- The inferential tension (permutation p=0.154 vs asymptotic p<0.001) now appears primarily in Section 6.7 (Design-Based Inference). Other sections reference it via cross-reference rather than restating. PASS.
- Key coefficients appear in their home sections without verbatim repetition. PASS.

### Literature Review
- Cut tangential "Information in Labor Markets" subsection. Retained all essential citations.
- Cut redundant "Contribution to the Literature" subsection (already covered in intro). PASS.

### Discussion & Conclusion
- Discussion now interprets rather than re-reports coefficients. PASS.
- Conclusion is two substantive paragraphs rather than a laundry list. PASS.

### Internal Consistency Check
- Lee bounds: lower=0.042, upper=0.050. Correct ordering. PASS.
- Trimming fraction: 1.4% (311/21,516). Consistent with appendix. PASS.
- Gender gap: 4-5pp in abstract matches Table 2 coefficients (0.040-0.056). PASS.
- Aggregate ATT: -0.4% matches Table 8 coefficient (-0.0038). PASS.

### Page Count
- 25 pages main text (before references). Meets minimum. PASS.

### Remaining Issues
- None critical. The revision accomplished its prose-tightening goals without introducing inconsistencies.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
