## REVISION RESPONSE

Following Round 1 concerns, several issues were addressed:

### Issues Fixed in This Revision:

1. **Referendum identification (CRITICAL)**: The paper now correctly identifies the March 3, 2013 vote as the "Federal Decree on Family Policy (Bundesbeschluss über die Familienpolitik)" - a parliamentary constitutional amendment that received 54.3% popular support but failed the Ständemehr. This is accurate.

2. **Control canton consistency**: Section 2.2 now clearly states the control group includes both never-adopters and later adopters (Lucerne, Schaffhausen) that were untreated in 2013.

3. **Table N consistency**: Tables 2 and 5 now report consistent N values (253, 262) for the fixed 10 km bandwidth specification.

4. **Language restriction acknowledged**: Section 4.3 clearly acknowledges the canton-level language restriction as a limitation.

### Remaining Concerns:

1. **Null result interpretation**: The main estimate is not statistically significant (p = 0.24). While honestly reported, this limits the publishable contribution.

2. **Turnout imbalance**: The significant turnout discontinuity (-4.6 pp, p = 0.001) remains concerning as a threat to identification.

3. **Limited pre-treatment balance**: Without pre-treatment covariates successfully merged, balance tests are incomplete.

## ASSESSMENT FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW

The paper has addressed the major internal consistency issues identified in Round 1:
- Referendum correctly identified
- Control cantons consistently defined
- Table N values aligned
- Language restriction clearly acknowledged as limitation

The paper is now internally consistent and ready for external review. Remaining weaknesses (null result, turnout imbalance, limited balance tests) are substantive design issues rather than errors.

**DECISION: MINOR REVISION**

The paper should proceed to external review. Remaining issues are design limitations that are properly acknowledged rather than errors.
