# Internal Review (Round 2)

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Paper:** Do State Automatic IRA Mandates Increase Retirement Savings Coverage?

---

## Summary

The revised paper addresses all major concerns from Round 1. The authors have added substantial new content: (1) a measurement considerations section explaining why CPS may not capture auto-IRA participation, (2) a thorough investigation of Oregon's puzzling negative effect with leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, (3) heterogeneity analysis by firm size, (4) power analysis, and (5) comprehensive robustness tables.

The paper now tells a more complete story: the headline null result masks meaningful positive effects that are obscured by Oregon's outlier status and measurement limitations.

## Strengths (Unchanged and New)

1. **Novel and policy-relevant question**: First quasi-experimental evaluation using nationally representative data.

2. **Methodologically sound**: Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator correctly handles staggered treatment.

3. **[NEW] Transparent about measurement limitations**: Section 4.4 is excellent. The CPS question wording analysis is convincing and the OregonSaves validation comparison is valuable.

4. **[NEW] Oregon investigation is thorough**: The leave-one-out analysis is the key contribution of this revision. Finding that excluding Oregon yields a significant 1.6pp effect (growing to 3.5pp over time) is important and policy-relevant.

5. **[NEW] Honest power analysis**: Helps readers understand what the study can and cannot detect.

6. **Clear, well-organized writing**: The paper flows logically and is accessible.

## Remaining Concerns

### Minor Issues

1. **Figure 2 (Parallel Trends)**: The figure shows pre-trends are approximately parallel, but the visual inspection could be strengthened. Consider adding a formal pre-trend test p-value to the figure caption or main text.

2. **Cohort table precision**: Table 4 reports ATT and SE to 3 decimal places (e.g., 0.026) but these are proportions, not percentage points. Either multiply by 100 and report as percentage points, or clarify units in the table header/notes.

3. **Abstract length**: The abstract is slightly long (~240 words). Consider tightening to ~200 words for journal submission.

4. **Literature review could mention**: Are there any working papers using CalSavers or OregonSaves administrative data that could be cited? Even if not published, acknowledging ongoing evaluation efforts would strengthen the literature positioning.

5. **Firm size results interpretation**: The paper notes that the lack of differential effects by firm size is "puzzling" but doesn't strongly conclude whether this is measurement error vs. genuine. Could be more definitive in interpretation.

## What Would Strengthen the Paper Further (Optional)

1. **Placebo test**: Run the analysis using a pre-period outcome (e.g., 2010-2015) with fake treatment dates to demonstrate no spurious effects.

2. **Heterogeneity by demographics**: Do effects differ by age, education, or income? This could inform policy targeting.

3. **Mechanism discussion**: Why might Illinois and California show positive effects while Oregon shows negative? Is it program design, compliance rates, or state-specific factors?

## Verdict

**MINOR REVISION**

The paper has addressed all major concerns from Round 1. The remaining issues are minor and can be addressed with straightforward edits. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the literature on state retirement policy evaluation and is approaching publication quality.

## Revision Priorities

1. Clarify units in Table 4 (or convert to percentage points)
2. Tighten abstract to ~200 words
3. Add pre-trend test p-value reference
4. Minor prose edits for polish
