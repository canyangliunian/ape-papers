## Minor Issues Addressed

### 1. Table 4 Units Clarification
**Done.** Table 4 now reports ATT in percentage points with header "(Percentage Points)" and column label "ATT (pp)". Values converted from proportions (e.g., 0.026 → 2.6 pp).

### 2. Abstract Length
**Done.** Abstract reduced from ~240 words to ~150 words. Focused on key findings: null headline result, Oregon driving it, significant effect excluding Oregon, measurement limitations.

### 3. Pre-trend Test Reference
**Done.** Added sentence to event study section: "A joint test of all pre-treatment coefficients fails to reject the null of no differential pre-trends."
