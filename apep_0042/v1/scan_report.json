This is not necessarily wrong, but it is a substantively different estimand/implementation than an individual-level DR DiD with covariates; aggregation changes weighting (especially with survey weights) and uncertainty. The paper should clearly state the unit of analysis used in estimation (state-year) and justify aggregation vs microdata DID.: The analysis uses microdata from the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) for years 2010--2024...\n...\nI use never-treated states as the control group, doubly robust estimation incorporating pre-treatment covariates, and cluster standard errors at the state level...",

If the reported wild-bootstrap p-value is intended for the C-S estimator, the code does not currently implement that; if it is intended as a TWFE approximation, the manuscript should say so explicitly.: # 2.

Instead, the script runs a wild *cluster* bootstrap on a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regression and treats it as an approximation, so the p-value corresponds to a different model/inferential procedure than what the abstract claims. This mismatch means the paper\u2019s key significance statement is not directly supported by the code as written.",
