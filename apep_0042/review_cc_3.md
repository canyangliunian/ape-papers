**Paper:** Do State Automatic IRA Mandates Increase Retirement Savings Coverage?

---

## Summary

The paper has undergone two rounds of revision and now addresses all major and minor concerns. The abstract is appropriately concise, tables use consistent units (percentage points), and the pre-trend test is referenced. The paper is ready for external review.

## Assessment

### Methodological Quality
The paper correctly applies the Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator for staggered DiD. Pre-trends are validated both visually (Figure 2) and through joint testing. The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis is well-executed and important for interpretation.

### Contribution
This is the first quasi-experimental evaluation of state auto-IRA mandates using nationally representative data. The finding that excluding Oregon yields significant positive effects (1.6 pp growing to 3.5 pp) is policy-relevant and novel. The measurement error discussion is valuable for future research.

### Presentation
The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and appropriately scoped. Figures and tables are publication-quality. The abstract efficiently conveys key findings.

### Limitations Acknowledged
The paper honestly discusses measurement limitations, Oregon's anomalous result, and power constraints. This transparency strengthens rather than weakens the contribution.

## Remaining Minor Issues

1. **Citation style**: Ensure all citations follow the target journal's format (currently appears to be AER style).

2. **Data availability statement**: Add explicit statement about data access (IPUMS-CPS requires registration but is publicly available).

These are extremely minor and do not require another revision round.

---

## Verdict

**CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT**

The paper is ready for external review. The conditional is on:
1. Final citation formatting check before submission
2. Adding data availability statement (can be done during external review phase)

The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the literature on state retirement policy evaluation and presents honest, well-analyzed findings.

## Recommendation

Proceed to external review (Phase 5B). The paper has successfully passed internal review after 3 rounds, meeting the minimum requirement.
