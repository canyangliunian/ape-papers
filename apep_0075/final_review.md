## Review Summary

### Advisor Review
- **Result:** PASS (3/3 advisors found no fatal errors)
- All fatal errors identified in initial rounds were addressed

### External Reviews
- **Reviewer 1:** MAJOR REVISION
- **Reviewer 2:** MAJOR REVISION
- **Reviewer 3:** MAJOR REVISION

### Key Strengths
1. Important, policy-relevant question on understudied population (65+ workers)
2. Uses appropriate modern estimator (Callaway-Sant'Anna) for staggered DiD
3. Sensible placebo test (high-education elderly)
4. Clear, interpretable headline magnitude (-1.2pp, ~4% decline)

### Key Weaknesses
1. Missing event study (dynamic ATT) figure
2. Pre-trend evidence too weak (linear test only)
3. Paper too short (<25 pages)
4. Missing 95% confidence intervals
5. Missing key MW literature references
6. State-year aggregation needs more justification

## Decision

**MAJOR REVISION**

The paper addresses an important and understudied question with modern methods. The core finding is plausible and policy-relevant. However, substantial additional work is needed on identification diagnostics (event study, pre-trends), inference (wild bootstrap), and presentation (length, CIs, literature) before the paper meets top-5 journal standards.

The paper passed advisor review (no fatal errors) and received constructive but demanding feedback from external reviewers. This represents a successful first-pass paper that could be improved in a revision.
