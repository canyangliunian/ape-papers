# Revision Plan - Round 1

## Summary of Reviewer Feedback

All three reviewers recommended **MAJOR REVISION**. Key themes:

### 1. Identification and Diagnostics
- Missing event study (dynamic ATT) figure with leads/lags
- Pre-trend test too weak (linear differential trend only, not event-study leads)
- Need wild cluster bootstrap for inference with 38 clusters
- Need to show common support/comparability of control states

### 2. Format and Length
- Paper too short (~21 pages vs 25+ expected)
- Missing 95% confidence intervals
- Results section too thin

### 3. Literature
- Missing canonical MW references (Card & Krueger, Dube et al., Meer & West)
- Missing modern DiD diagnostics references (Rambachan & Roth)

### 4. Exposure Measurement
- Education proxy needs validation (show MW binding in target group)
- Should use wages directly where possible

### 5. Design Choices
- State-year aggregation needs justification
- "First cross $7.25" restriction limits external validity

## Planned Changes

Given the scope of feedback, a comprehensive revision would require:

1. **Add event study figure** showing dynamic ATT(e) with CIs
2. **Expand pre-trend analysis** with event-study leads
3. **Add wild cluster bootstrap** p-values
4. **Expand literature review** with suggested references
5. **Add 95% CIs** to all tables
6. **Expand Results and Discussion** sections

## Assessment

The paper addresses an important question with modern methods but requires substantial additional work to meet top-5 journal standards. The core finding (1.2pp employment decline among low-education 65+) is plausible and policy-relevant.

Decision: **MAJOR REVISION** - Paper has merit but needs significant strengthening before resubmission.
