# Reply to Reviewers - Round 1

We thank all three reviewers for their careful and constructive feedback. Below we respond to the main concerns.

## Response to Common Themes

### 1. Missing Event Study Figure

**Concern:** All reviewers noted the absence of a dynamic event study (ATT by event time) figure.

**Response:** We acknowledge this is a significant omission. An event study figure with leads and lags is essential for assessing pre-trends and dynamics in staggered DiD designs. A revision would add this figure using C&S group-time ATTs aggregated by event time.

### 2. Weak Pre-Trend Evidence

**Concern:** The linear differential trend test is insufficient; need event-study leads with joint tests.

**Response:** Agreed. The current linear trend test is a minimal check. A proper revision would show multiple pre-treatment leads (e.g., -5 to -1) with confidence intervals and a joint F-test.

### 3. Few-Cluster Inference

**Concern:** With 38 state clusters, conventional cluster-robust SEs may be unreliable.

**Response:** We will add wild cluster bootstrap p-values for main estimates.

### 4. Missing Literature

**Concern:** Key minimum wage and DiD references are absent.

**Response:** We will add:
- Card & Krueger (1994)
- Dube, Lester & Reich (2010)
- Meer & West (2016)
- Clemens & Wither (2019)
- Rambachan & Roth (2023)

### 5. Manuscript Length

**Concern:** Paper is too short for top-journal standards.

**Response:** Expansion of Results, Discussion, and Robustness sections would address length concerns while strengthening the evidentiary base.

### 6. 95% Confidence Intervals

**Concern:** Main results lack 95% CIs.

**Response:** We will add CIs to all main tables.

## Conclusion

The reviewers' feedback is constructive and actionable. A major revision addressing these points would substantially strengthen the paper's contribution.
