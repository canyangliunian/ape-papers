This constructs synthetic policy paths that likely do not match actual statutory minimum wages (which change discretely, often annually, sometimes mid-year and with indexing/localities). Because the minimum wage variable is the treatment, this is effectively fabricated/constructed key explanatory data and can materially change estimates.: state_mw_changes <- tribble(\n  ~state, ~state_name, ~first_treat_year, ~mw_2022,\n  # Early movers (already above federal by 2010)\n  6,  \"California\", 2008, 15.00,\n  ...\n  55, \"Wisconsin\", 2005, 7.25  # Tied to federal\n)\n...\nmutate(\n  # Interpolate state MW from first treat year to 2022\n  state_mw = case_when(\n    is.na(first_treat_year) ~ fed_mw,\n    year < first_treat_year ~ fed_mw,\n    year >= first_treat_year ~ fed_mw + (mw_2022 - fed_mw) * (year - first_treat_year) / (2022 - first_treat_year),\n    TRUE ~ fed_mw\n  ),\n  eff_mw = pmax(state_mw, fed_mw)\n)",

In contrast, the code defines 'low_wage_likely' using industry/occupation indicators (INDP/OCCP), which are typically missing for non-employed individuals in ACS PUMS. This can induce selection/composition differences and directly contradicts the stated rationale and sample definition in the paper.: low_wage_likely = (hs_or_less & (retail | food_service | service_occ | admin_support))\n...\n# Low-wage likely sample (main analysis sample)\ncps_lowwage <- cps_clean %>%\n  filter(low_wage_likely)",

With `na.rm=TRUE`, this can unintentionally drop non-employed observations from denominators for these subgroup rates, inflating employment rates and potentially affecting treatment effects if missingness differs by treatment/time. This is especially concerning for the 'low_wage_likely' outcome used as primary in several scripts/tables.: emp_rate_lowedu = weighted.mean(employed[hs_or_less], weight[hs_or_less], na.rm = TRUE),\n...\nemp_rate_service = weighted.mean(employed[service_occ], weight[service_occ], na.rm = TRUE),\n...\nemp_rate_lowwage = weighted.mean(employed[low_wage_likely], weight[low_wage_likely], na.rm = TRUE)",

This does not test differential trends versus controls as described and can miss confounding common shocks in the pre-period.: # Restrict to pre-treatment period for treated states\ndf_pretrends <- state_year %>%\n  filter(ever_treated) %>%\n  filter(year < first_treat_year)\n...\npretrend_test <- feols(\n  emp_rate_lowwage ~ years_to_treat | state,\n  data = df_pretrends,\n  cluster = ~state\n)",

Several headline figures are not reproducible because their inputs are hard-coded as literal vectors (including \u201cillustrative\u201d ATT/SE values for a heterogeneity plot) rather than computed from the underlying data and model outputs. The data pipeline also conflicts with the paper\u2019s description by pulling ACS PUMS for 2010\u20132023 (and even labeling the script as CPS), introducing mismatched sample years relative to the claimed 2010\u20132022 ACS analysis.",
