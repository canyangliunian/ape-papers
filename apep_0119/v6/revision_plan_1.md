# Revision Plan: apep_0119 v6

## Parent: apep_0119 (v5)
## Summary: Shleifer-Style Prose Overhaul + Targeted Empirical Additions

### Structural Changes
1. Flattened section hierarchy from 10 to 9 sections
2. Merged Heterogeneity section into Results
3. Consolidated Robustness from 9 subsections to 3 (Alternative Estimators & Controls, Inference & Sensitivity, Placebo & Falsification)
4. Eliminated all enumerated lists (predictions, specifications, variable definitions converted to prose)
5. Removed roadmap paragraph from introduction

### Introduction Rewrite
- Expanded from ~1.5 pages to ~5 pages of flowing narrative
- Opens with concrete fact creating tension (household spending vs engineering claims)
- Weaves literature citations into the argument (not listed separately)
- Contributions emerge organically from narrative
- Added literature context sections (energy efficiency gap, modern DiD methods, welfare/SCC)

### New Empirical Analyses
1. **Industrial placebo**: CS-DiD on industrial electricity — result is -19.3% (not null), discussed honestly as complicating clean falsification
2. **Commercial sector**: CS-DiD on commercial electricity — -6.5% (p<0.01), corroborates main finding
3. **COVID robustness**: Excluding 2020-2022 yields identical -4.2% estimate
4. Updated robustness summary table with all new specifications

### New References Added
- Metcalf & Hassett (1999) — engineering-econometric gap
- Mildenberger et al. (2022) — prior TWFE state-level study
- Abadie, Diamond & Hainmueller (2010) — synthetic control foundation

### Prose Quality
- Active voice throughout
- Eliminated throat-clearing phrases
- Results contextualized before citing table/figure numbers
- Varied sentence rhythm
- Conclusion reframed with forward-looking research agenda
