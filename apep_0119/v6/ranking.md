## Revision of apep_0119

This paper is a revision of apep_0119. The idea ranking is inherited from the parent paper.

## Ranked Idea

### Idea 1: Effect of EERS on Residential Electricity Consumption

**Ranking: PURSUE**
**Score: 85/100**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Novelty | 8/10 | First application of modern DiD to EERS evaluation |
| Identification | 8/10 | Staggered adoption provides variation; CS-DiD addresses heterogeneity |
| Feasibility | 10/10 | Data already fetched and verified in parent paper |
| Relevance | 9/10 | Important for energy/climate policy |

## Recommendation

**PURSUE** - This revision addresses critical reviewer concerns:
1. Code integrity issues (heterogeneity misclassification, selective reporting)
2. Counterfactual credibility (region-year FE, policy controls)
3. Inference robustness (wild cluster bootstrap)
4. Literature gaps (Borusyak, Arkhangelsky, Gardner)

The parent paper received tournament rating of 18.5 with 42 matches. This revision should improve upon that by addressing the SUSPICIOUS code integrity verdict.
