## Follow-up Review After Round 1

### Issues from Round 1 - Status

All major issues from Round 1 have been addressed or acknowledged in the paper:

1. **NAICS 7132 measurement limitation** - Explicitly discussed in Section 4.2 with appropriate caveats
2. **Treatment timing** - Section 3.5 clarifies the coding rule and acknowledges inclusive approach
3. **Displacement effects** - Discussed in Section 8.1 as a factor explaining the gap vs. industry projections

### Remaining Minor Issues

1. **Table formatting:** Some tables could use more consistent decimal places
2. **Figure captions:** Figure 6 caption could note that full leave-one-out analysis was conducted for all 34 states (currently notes "First 10 Treated States")

These are minor and do not prevent publication.

### Assessment

The paper is ready for external review. It:
- Meets all methodological requirements
- Uses appropriate estimators for staggered DiD
- Provides comprehensive robustness checks
- Discusses limitations honestly
- Is well-written and accessible
