\item \textit{Notes:} Column (1) reports the Callaway-Sant'Anna (2021) average treatment effect on the treated using not-yet-treated and never-treated states as controls. In our sample, the 16 never-treated states provide the dominant comparison group since most treated states adopted by 2021; late adopters (2022--2024) contribute limited not-yet-treated person-years. Column (2) reports traditional TWFE for comparison. Standard errors clustered at state level in parentheses; 95\% CI in brackets. *** p<0.01.
