## Recommendation

PURSUE - This revision addresses all major concerns raised by reviewers on the original apep_0038. The identification strategy is strong (Murphy provides exogenous variation), data are available and accessible, and the topic is policy-relevant. The addition of HonestDiD sensitivity, iGaming controls, and COVID robustness checks substantially strengthens the analysis.
