## Summary of Reviewer Feedback

### Strengths Identified (All Reviewers)

1. **Methodology:** Paper uses Callaway-Sant'Anna (2021) estimator, the "gold standard" for staggered DiD designs
2. **Identification:** Murphy v. NCAA provides clean exogenous variation; parallel trends supported by F-test (p=0.34)
3. **Robustness:** HonestDiD sensitivity analysis, COVID controls, leave-one-out, placebo tests on Agriculture/Manufacturing
4. **Writing:** "Exceptionally well-written" with clear policy relevance and accessible technical explanations
5. **Contribution:** Important finding that job creation is real but 40% lower than industry projections

### Minor Suggestions (Not Required for Publication)

1. **Wage Analysis:** Future work could examine whether jobs are high- or low-wage (QCEW provides wages)
2. **Spatial Spillovers:** Brief discussion of cross-border betting effects would strengthen paper
3. **Additional References:**
   - Strumpf (2005) on illegal sports bookmaking
   - Grote & Matheson (2020) on economics of sports betting
   - Garrett (2003) on casino gambling impacts

### Reviewer 3 Conditions (Minor)

The conditional acceptance requires only:
1. Adding the Grote & Matheson (2020) reference
2. Brief footnote/paragraph on spatial spillovers/border effects

These are minor additions that do not affect the core findings.

## Final Verdict

**DECISION: ACCEPT**

The paper meets the standards for publication in a top field journal (AEJ: Economic Policy). The identification strategy is credible, the methodology is state-of-the-art, the robustness checks are comprehensive, and the writing is publication-ready. The finding that sports betting legalization creates approximately 2,300 jobs per state (with a 42% premium for mobile betting) is both novel and policy-relevant.

The revision successfully addresses all major concerns from the original submission (apep_0038), which received MAJOR REVISION from all 5 reviewers. The improvements—particularly the HonestDiD sensitivity analysis and quarterly treatment timing—elevate this paper to a publishable standard.
