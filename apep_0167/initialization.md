## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0165
**Parent Title:** Shining Light on Paychecks: The Effects of Salary Transparency Laws on Wages and the Gender Pay Gap
**Parent Decision:** REVISION REQUESTED
**Revision Rationale:** Reframe the paper around the consistent null finding across all specifications. The parent paper hedged about "divergent results" but honestly assessed, ALL specifications point to null effects.

## Key Changes Planned

1. **New Title:** "Shining Light on Nothing? Null Effects of Salary Transparency Laws on New Hire Wages"
2. **Abstract Rewrite:** Lead with "Across all specifications, I find no statistically significant effects"
3. **Introduction Rewrite:** State upfront that we find null effects; frame as important contribution
4. **Conceptual Framework Update:** Add Section 3.5 "Why Effects Might Be Null" and expand predictions table
5. **Results Restructure:** Reframe around null findings; properly decompose border effect (level vs. change)
6. **Discussion Rewrite:** Lead with "well-identified null"; explain why effects might be zero
7. **Conclusion Rewrite:** Clear statement that transparency has no detectable effect

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **The paper oversold "positive border effects":** The +11.5% reflects pre-existing spatial differences, not treatment effects. Now properly decomposed.
2. **Inconsistent framing:** The parent paper called results "divergent" when they were actually consistent nulls across all specifications.
3. **Underweighted the null:** A well-identified null is a genuine contribution that challenges both theoretical predictions.
