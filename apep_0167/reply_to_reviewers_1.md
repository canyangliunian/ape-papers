## Response to Pre-Planned Revision

This revision implements a complete reframing of apep_0165 based on the honest assessment that ALL specifications point to null effects. The parent paper hedged about "divergent results" when the results were actually consistent nulls.

### Issue 1: Overselling Border Effects
**Original concern:** The +11.5% border effect was presented as a significant positive finding.

**Response:** We now properly decompose this into:
- Pre-existing spatial differences: ~10 percentage points
- Treatment-induced change: +3.3% (SE = 2.5%), not significant

This decomposition is now emphasized throughout the paper, including a dedicated section (7.5) and updated summary table.

### Issue 2: Inconsistent Framing
**Original concern:** The paper called results "divergent" when they were consistent nulls.

**Response:** The paper is now framed around the null finding:
- New title emphasizes "Null Effects"
- Abstract leads with "Across all specifications, I find no statistically significant effects"
- Summary table (Table 5) shows consistent null across all specs

### Issue 3: Underweighting the Null
**Original concern:** A well-identified null is a genuine contribution but wasn't presented that way.

**Response:** The discussion now explicitly argues:
- The null is informative (design has power to detect effects of theoretical magnitude)
- Neither wage declines (commitment mechanism) nor gender gap narrowing (info equalization) observed
- Policy implications: "Neither fear nor hope is warranted"

## Conclusion
All planned revisions implemented. The paper now honestly presents what the data show: salary transparency laws have no detectable effect on new hire wages or gender pay gaps in the short run.
