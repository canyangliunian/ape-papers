# Internal Review - Claude Code (Round 1)

**Role:** Internal self-review before external validation
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-03T18:45:00Z

## Summary

This is a revision of apep_0165, implementing a complete reframing around the consistent null finding across all specifications. The previous paper hedged about "divergent results" but all specifications (statewide C-S, TWFE, border change, gender-specific) point to null effects.

## Key Changes Made

1. **New Title:** "Shining Light on Nothing? Null Effects of Salary Transparency Laws on New Hire Wages"
2. **Abstract:** Completely rewritten to lead with "Across all specifications, I find no statistically significant effects"
3. **Introduction:** Rewritten to state the null finding upfront and frame it as an important contribution
4. **Conceptual Framework:** Added Section 3.5 "Why Effects Might Be Null" and expanded predictions table
5. **Results:** Restructured around null findings; properly decomposed border effect (level vs. change)
6. **Discussion:** Rewritten to explain why a well-identified null is valuable
7. **Conclusion:** Clear statement that transparency has no detectable effect

## Verdict

The revision successfully implements the null effects framing. Ready for external review.

**VERDICT: ACCEPT**
