## PART 1: CRITICAL REVIEW

### Format Check
- **Length:** Approximately 26 pages main text + 8 pages appendix. PASS.
- **References:** 9 references covering key literature (Chetty et al., Putnam, Rodriguez-Pose). Adequate for descriptive paper.
- **Prose:** Full paragraphs throughout. No bullet-point sections in main text. PASS.
- **Figures:** 10 main figures + 10 appendix figures, all with proper axes and labels. PASS.
- **Tables:** 5 tables with real coefficients, standard errors, R², and N. PASS.

### Statistical Methodology
- All regression tables include standard errors in parentheses. PASS.
- Sample sizes reported (N ≈ 2,985-2,992). PASS.
- R² reported for all specifications. PASS.
- This is a descriptive/correlational paper, not causal inference, so DiD/RDD requirements not applicable.

### Identification Strategy
- Paper explicitly frames as descriptive and correlational. No causal claims made.
- Limitations section acknowledges reverse causality, omitted variables, and ecological fallacy.
- Appropriate for the descriptive framing.

### Literature
- Covers Chetty et al. social capital papers adequately.
- Could add more political science literature on geographic polarization.

### Writing Quality
- Strong narrative arc from credit → social capital → politics.
- Clear paragraph transitions.
- Accessible to non-specialists.

## PART 2: CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS

1. Consider adding individual-level analysis to address ecological fallacy concerns
2. Could explore temporal dynamics more (how did these patterns evolve?)
3. Interaction effects between credit and social capital could be interesting

## Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Beautiful figures and clear presentation
- Novel data combination (credit + social capital + voting)
- Honest about limitations

**Weaknesses:**
- Purely descriptive - no causal identification
- Limited policy implications without causal evidence

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
