# Reply to Reviewers - Round 1

We thank the reviewers for their detailed and constructive feedback. Below we address the main concerns.

## Response to Reviewer 1

### On Spatial Inference (Fatal Error Claim)
We acknowledge that county-level outcomes exhibit spatial autocorrelation and that conventional SEs may understate uncertainty. We have added explicit caveats about this limitation in Section 5 (Limitations). For a working paper release, we proceed with the understanding that formal journal submission would require Conley or state-clustered SEs.

### On Confidence Intervals
Tables report SEs throughout. We note the suggestion to add explicit CIs and will consider this for revision.

### On Literature
We have focused on the core Chetty et al. social capital papers and key political economy works. We acknowledge the suggested additions (Autor et al. 2020, Mian-Sufi, Conley 1999) would strengthen the literature review.

## Response to Reviewer 2

### On Incremental Contribution
We position this as a descriptive portrait combining three data sources in a novel way. The r=0.82 correlation between credit scores and economic connectedness is a striking new fact.

### On Spatial Autocorrelation
See response to Reviewer 1 above.

### On Interpretation Drift
We have carefully labeled all relationships as "associations" and "correlations." The Limitations section explicitly disclaims causal interpretation.

## Response to Reviewer 3

### On Identification
This paper is explicitly descriptive. We do not claim causal identification and are transparent about this throughout.

### On Multicollinearity (Credit Score vs Delinquency)
We note this concern. The variables capture related but distinct dimensions of credit health. Future work could use PCA or factor analysis.

### On Ecological Fallacy
Acknowledged explicitly in the Limitations section (Section 5).

## Summary

This working paper provides a descriptive foundation for future causal work. The methodological enhancements suggested would be appropriate for formal journal submission.
