The code uses a variable named 'delinq90_0' (shrunk_xkid_delinq90_02020), which strongly suggests a 90+ day (serious) delinquency definition. This is a substantive measurement mismatch that could affect the level and interpretation of delinquency, the reported summary statistics, and the regressions involving delinquency.: delinquency <- fread(file.path(data_dir, \"delinquency_county.csv\")) %>%\n  filter(kid_race == \"Pooled\", par_pctile == -9) %>%\n  select(state = par_state, county = par_county, delinquency = shrunk_xkid_delinq90_02020) %>%\n  mutate(fips = sprintf(\"%02d%03d\", state, county))",

If used for inference/subgroup analysis, it should be documented explicitly (the manuscript mentions density controls, but not this constructed urban dummy).: mutate(\n  credit_score_z = scale(credit_score)[,1],\n  ec_z = scale(ec)[,1],\n  delinquency_z = scale(delinquency)[,1],\n  student_loan_z = scale(student_loan)[,1],\n  # Urban indicator (top quartile of density)\n  urban = popdensity > quantile(popdensity, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),\n  # State FIPS\n  state_fips = substr(fips, 1, 2)\n)",

In `03_figures_main.R`, the \u201chigh/low\u201d typology is coded using `credit_score_z > 0` and `ec_z > 0` (above the mean in z-scores) rather than the stated above/below *median* split referenced in the text and Figure 10 caption. In `01_load_data.R`, the delinquency outcome is constructed from a `delin...` variable in a way that does not align with the paper\u2019s definition of \u201cany account 30+ days past due\u201d (with ~45% prevalence) versus separate 90+ day serious delinquency (typically 5\u201310%), indicating the code may be using a different delinquency threshold or measure than described.",
