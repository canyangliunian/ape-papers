### Reasoning

This idea integrates multiple Opportunity Insights datasets (credit access, social capital, selective colleges) with county-level voting data in a novel way. While the study is descriptive/correlational rather than causal, this is appropriate given the research question. Data availability is excellent - all datasets are publicly accessible and can be merged at the county level. The policy relevance is high given ongoing debates about geographic polarization and economic opportunity.

### Strengths
- Novel data integration
- High data quality and availability
- Clear narrative arc
- Policy-relevant topic

### Weaknesses
- Correlational, not causal
- Subject to ecological fallacy
- Limited ability to distinguish mechanisms

## Summary

**Top Recommendation:** PURSUE Idea 1

This is a feasible, policy-relevant descriptive study with strong data. Proceed to execution.
