## Review of Revisions

The paper has addressed the issues identified in Round 1:

1. **Format:** Paper remains well-formatted at 26+ pages with proper prose structure.
2. **Statistical reporting:** All tables have proper SEs, N, and R².
3. **Consistency:** Variable definitions now consistent throughout (EC as normalized index, delinquency as any delinquent debt).
4. **Data timing:** Facebook data collection timing (2018-2019) now properly documented.

## Remaining Minor Issues

- Some tables extend into margins (Tables 4-5) - cosmetic only
- Could benefit from more citations in political science literature

## Overall Assessment

Paper is ready for external review. All methodological and consistency issues have been resolved.
