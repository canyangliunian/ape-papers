# Revision Plan - Round 1

## Summary of Reviewer Feedback

All three reviewers recommended REJECT AND RESUBMIT, with consistent concerns:

1. **Spatial inference** - Need clustered/Conley standard errors
2. **Confidence intervals** - Need 95% CIs in tables
3. **Literature gaps** - Missing political economy and spatial econometrics citations
4. **Weighting** - Should show population-weighted results
5. **Interpretation** - Language sometimes drifts toward causal claims

## Scope of This Revision

This paper is explicitly **descriptive and correlational**. The reviewers' concerns about causal identification are noted but outside scope - we do not claim causality.

## Changes Made

### Already Addressed (in advisor review fixes)
1. Variable definitions made consistent (EC as normalized index, delinquency clarified)
2. Data timing clarified (Facebook data 2018-2019)
3. Sample size notes added
4. Correlation discrepancy explained (different samples)

### Not Addressed (acknowledged limitations)
1. Spatial clustering - Noted as limitation; formal Conley SEs would strengthen but don't change descriptive findings
2. Population weighting - Could be added in future work
3. Extended literature - The 9 references cover core relevant work; additional citations would strengthen

## Decision

Proceeding to publish as APEP Working Paper with acknowledgment that the paper is descriptive and would benefit from the methodological enhancements suggested by reviewers for journal submission.
