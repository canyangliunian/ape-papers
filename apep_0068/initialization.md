3. Yes - all API keys configured
4. Yes (Recommended) - GPT 5.2 reviews after internal rounds
5. Novel angle (Recommended) - Classic data (Chetty) + new question combining credit, social capital, elitism, polarization
6. BOTH: Combine elite institution focus with geographic polarization analysis. The trick will be to have an interesting and novel narrative arc in the paper, backed up with great exhibits (figures and tables). At least 10 exhibits in main manuscript and 10 exhibits in appendix.
