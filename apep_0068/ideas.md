## Idea 1: Credit, Social Capital, and America's Elite Networks: Geographic Segregation and Political Polarization

**Research Question:** How do credit access, economic connectedness (cross-class social networks), and elite institution concentration interact geographically, and are these patterns correlated with political polarization at the county level?

**Policy Relevance:**
- Understanding whether credit access divides reinforce social network segregation
- Examining whether elite institution concentration creates "winner-take-all" geographies
- Assessing whether these economic-social divides correlate with political polarization

**Data Sources (All Verified and Downloaded):**
1. **Credit Access (Opportunity Insights 2020):** Credit scores, student loans, mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, delinquency rates by county (~3,100 counties)
2. **Social Capital II (Chetty et al. 2022):** Economic connectedness (cross-class friendships), friending bias, clustering by county (~3,000 counties)
3. **139 Selective Colleges (Chetty et al. 2023):** Attendance by parental income percentile for elite institutions
4. **100×100 SES Friendship Matrix:** National friending probabilities between all SES percentile pairs
5. **County Covariates:** Employment, education, income, demographics 1980-2010
6. **Voting Data (2016-2024):** County-level presidential vote shares, GOP/DEM margins

**Identification:** Descriptive + correlational analysis (NOT causal). Two-part structure:
- **Part 1:** Rich descriptive exhibits showing geographic patterns of credit, social capital, elitism
- **Part 2:** Correlational analysis linking these patterns to political polarization

**What Makes This Novel:**
1. **Integration of multiple Chetty datasets** - No existing paper combines credit access, social capital, and elite college data at county level
2. **Political polarization angle** - Links economic divides (credit, networks) to political outcomes
3. **Elitism measurement** - Uses selective college attendance patterns to map "elite geography"
4. **Visual storytelling** - 10+ main exhibits, 10+ appendix exhibits tell compelling narrative

**Feasibility Check:**
- ✅ All data downloaded and verified (17 files, ~25MB)
- ✅ County FIPS codes enable merging across all datasets
- ✅ ~3,100 counties provide adequate variation
- ✅ No prior APEP paper covers this combination
- ✅ Not overstudied in literature (novel integration)

**Proposed Exhibits (Main Text):**

1. **Map: Credit Score Geography** - Choropleth showing county-level credit scores
2. **Map: Economic Connectedness Geography** - Cross-class friendship rates by county
3. **Map: Elite College Access Geography** - Where do students at top 139 colleges come from?
4. **Figure: The Friendship Matrix** - Heatmap of 100×100 SES friending probabilities
5. **Figure: Credit-Social Capital Correlation** - Scatter plot showing relationship
6. **Map: Republican Vote Share 2020** - Political geography baseline
7. **Map: Change in GOP Vote Share 2016-2024** - Polarization trends
8. **Figure: Credit Access and Political Polarization** - Correlation analysis
9. **Figure: Economic Connectedness and Political Polarization** - Key relationship
10. **Figure: Geographic Clustering** - Spatial clustering of credit-social-political patterns

**Proposed Exhibits (Appendix):**
- Student loan geography
- Mortgage balance geography
- Delinquency rate geography
- Credit card balance geography
- Auto loan geography
- Urban/rural breakdown
- Regional breakdowns
- Robustness to different polarization measures
- Time series of polarization trends
- Alternative specifications

## Idea 2: The Geography of Elite Capture: How Selective College Networks Shape Local Economic Outcomes

**Research Question:** Do counties with higher "exposure" to elite college networks have different credit access and intergenerational mobility patterns?

**Status:** Alternative idea if primary idea encounters issues. Similar data, different framing.

## Recommended: Pursue Idea 1

Idea 1 has the most compelling narrative arc: starting with credit markets, connecting to social networks, revealing elite concentration, and ultimately showing how these patterns correlate with political polarization. The visual storytelling potential is enormous.
