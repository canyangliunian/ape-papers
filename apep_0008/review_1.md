## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages, excl. refs/appendix): FAIL**  
   - The manuscript as provided appears to be ~10 pages total (page numbers run 1–10, including appendix headings). This is **well under 20 pages**, so it fails the length requirement.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography): FAIL**  
   - The bibliography lists **5 references** (Bae & Timmons 2023; Deyo & Plemmons 2022; Johnson & Kleiner 2018; Johnson 2012; Kleiner 2015). This is far below 15 (and below 10).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): FAIL**  
   - Multiple sections use bullet points instead of fully developed prose paragraphs, including:
     - **Section 2.2** (“provided the applicant: …” bullet list)
     - **Section 3.1** (“Our key variables include:” bullet list)
     - **Appendix A** pre-analysis plan bullet list  
   - This violates the requirement as stated (and the writing reads like notes in places rather than journal prose).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs): FAIL**  
   - Several major sections are too short / not developed enough:
     - **Introduction (Section 1)**: ~2–3 short paragraphs (not 3–4 substantive paragraphs with framing, contribution, preview, and roadmap).
     - **Data and Methods (Section 3)**: broken into subsections, but each is brief; overall reads more like a short memo than a full journal-style data/methods section.
     - **Results (Section 4)**: very short; limited model detail (exact regression tables/specifications not shown beyond summary DiD table).
     - **Conclusion (Section 6)**: ~1–2 paragraphs.
   - Net: the paper does not meet the “major section depth” requirement.

5. **Figures (all figures show visible data): PASS (N/A)**  
   - No figures are included in the provided manuscript text. Since there are none to evaluate for being “empty/broken,” this item is effectively N/A.

6. **Tables (no placeholders): PASS**  
   - Tables 1–4 contain numeric values/dates and do not show placeholders like “TBD/XXX.”

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Substantially increase manuscript length** to at least **25 pages** (excluding references/appendix). This typically requires: fuller literature review, richer institutional/policy detail, expanded data description, full regression tables, robustness checks, event-study plots, heterogeneity, and limitations/interpretation.
2. **Expand the bibliography to at least 15 references** (currently 5). This must include key domain papers on licensing/mobility and key DiD/event-study methodology references.
3. **Replace bullet lists with paragraph prose** in the Introduction/Literature/Results/Discussion (and ideally throughout). Convert the “key variables include” and ULR eligibility bullets into narrative text.
4. **Expand each major section to 3–4 substantive paragraphs** (Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion). Right now several sections read underdeveloped for journal standards.
5. (Optional but strongly recommended) **Add figures** typical for DiD papers (event-study coefficient plot with CIs; migration trends by treatment/control; map/table of adopters; robustness visuals). While not required by your checklist, the absence of figures is a presentation weakness for an empirical DiD paper.

Per your instructions, I will **not proceed to Phase 2 (content review)** until these format issues are addressed.
