## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - Approximate pagination shown in the manuscript: main text runs from p.1 through p.19 (Conclusion ends on p.19), with **References on pp.20–21** and **Appendices on pp.22–24**.  
   - **Excluding references and appendices, the paper is ~19 pages**, which is **under 20**, so this is a clear FAIL under the stated rule.

2. **References (≥15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
   - The bibliography lists **~22 references** (well above 15).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet-point sections in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Background/Literature, Results, and Discussion are written in paragraph form (tables are fine).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction: multiple substantive paragraphs.  
   - Literature/Background: multiple subsections with multiple paragraphs.  
   - Data/Methods: multiple paragraphs across 3.1–3.5.  
   - Results: multiple paragraphs across 4.1–4.4.  
   - Conclusion: at least ~3 paragraphs (main finding + implications + future research).

5. **Figures (all figures show visible data)**: **PASS (N/A)**  
   - No figures are included/shown in the provided manuscript excerpt; therefore there are **no broken/empty figures to fail** on this criterion.

6. **Tables (no placeholders; real numbers)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables shown (Table 1–4, plus summary tables) contain numerical values, no “TBD/XXX” placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Issues that must be fixed before content review
- **Insufficient length**: The paper’s **main text is ~19 pages** (excluding references and appendices), but the requirement is **≥25 pages**.  
  - To pass, you need to **add ~6+ pages of substantive main-text content** (not references/appendix padding). Potentially expand: institutional details on ULR implementation differences, a clearer conceptual framework, a fuller methods section (weighting, clustering/inference choices, staggered DiD details), fuller presentation of event-study estimates (with a figure), and deeper robustness/heterogeneity and interpretation.

Per your instructions, I will **not proceed to Phase 2** until the Phase 1 length issue is resolved.
