## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excl. references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - Approximate length from the provided manuscript: **~19 pages total** (page numbers run 1–19, with References starting ~p.16 and Appendices following). This is **well under 25 pages** even *including* references/appendix, so it necessarily fails the ≥25 pages **excluding** references/appendix requirement.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
   - Counted **~22 references** in the bibliography (e.g., Kleiner 2000/2006/2015; Johnson 2012; Johnson & Kleiner 2018; Molloy et al. 2017; Kaplan & Schulhofer-Wohl 2017; etc.).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet-point sections in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **PASS**  
   - Sections shown are written in paragraph form; no bullet-point formatting in the checked sections.

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Background/Literature, Data/Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion all appear to have multiple substantive paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not empty/broken)**: **PASS (no figures provided)**  
   - In the provided version, I see **tables** but **no figures** to evaluate. There are therefore no broken/empty figures *in evidence*.

6. **Tables (real numbers; no placeholders like TBD/XXX)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables shown (e.g., adoption timing, summary stats, DiD results, event-study rates) contain numerical values, not placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Must-fix format issues before content review
- **Length is below the required minimum.** The manuscript appears to be **~19 pages total**, whereas the requirement is **≥25 pages excluding references/appendix**.  
  - To fix: expand the main text substantially (typical places: richer institutional background on ULR heterogeneity/exemptions; deeper data/measurement discussion, especially licensed-occupation classification validity; fuller event-study and inference approach; additional robustness/heterogeneity; clearer policy counterfactuals; limitations; and possibly an expanded appendix with diagnostics *while still keeping ≥25 pages in main text*).

Per your instructions, I will **not proceed to Phase 2 (content review)** until the format issue above is resolved.
