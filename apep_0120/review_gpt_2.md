## Referee Report: “State Minimum Wage Increases and Young Adult Household Formation: Evidence from Staggered Adoption” (APEP Autonomous Research, Jan 30, 2026)

### Summary of the paper
The paper asks whether state minimum-wage increases enable young adults (18–34) to form independent households, proxied by the ACS share living with parents. Using a 51-jurisdiction panel (2015–2019, 2021–2022), treatment is defined as the first year a state’s effective minimum wage exceeds the federal floor by ≥$1. The main estimator is Callaway–Sant’Anna (2021) DiD with staggered adoption, primarily using never-treated states as controls. The headline estimate is an imprecise null: ATT = −0.540 pp (SE 0.446). Many robustness checks also yield nulls.

Below I give a demanding top-journal review. The paper clears several *minimum econometric* bars (proper staggered DiD, clustering, CIs, placebo outcome), but it is **not currently competitive for AER/QJE/JPE/ReStud/Ecta/AEJ:EP** because the design and data are too aggregated/diluted for the question, identification threats are under-addressed (including fixable ones), and the contribution is not yet positioned as a high-impact result.

---

# 1. FORMAT CHECK (fixable but must be flagged)

### Length
- The PDF excerpt appears to run to **~46 pages total** including appendices (Tables 7–10, appendices B–E, figures).  
- The *main text* appears to end around the References at **p. 34**, so **~33 pages of main text** (excluding references/appendix). This clears the “25 pages” bar.

### References coverage
- The bibliography covers many core minimum-wage and DiD methodology citations (Card–Krueger; Dube; Cengiz et al.; Callaway–Sant’Anna; Sun–Abraham; Goodman-Bacon; de Chaisemartin–D’Haultfœuille; Rambachan–Roth).
- However, it is **thin on (i) credible-design minimum wage meta-method guidance**, (ii) **event-study implementation best practices**, and (iii) **U.S.-focused empirical work on living arrangements/household formation during recessions and policy changes** (details and BibTeX below).

### Prose (paragraph form vs bullets)
- Major sections (Introduction pp. 2–4; Background pp. 5–6; Results pp. 16–33; Discussion pp. 32–33) are in **paragraph form**.
- Bullets are used mostly for variable construction and table descriptions (Data appendix, variable definitions). That is acceptable.

### Section depth (≥3 substantive paragraphs each)
- **Introduction**: yes (multiple paragraphs).
- **Institutional background**: yes.
- **Conceptual framework**: borderline—Section 3 is short and equation-driven; it could use more narrative intuition and explicit mapping to empirical specifications.
- **Data**: yes.
- **Results/Robustness**: yes.
- **Discussion**: yes.

### Figures
- Figures shown (e.g., Figure 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) have axes, units, and visible data. Good.
- For a top journal submission, you will need **publication-quality vector graphics** and consistent formatting (font sizes, grayscale-friendly palettes, figure notes). The current plots look like a working-paper style.

### Tables
- Tables include real numbers (no placeholders). N and SEs are reported in main tables.

**Format red flag for top journals**: the paper includes an “Acknowledgements” line stating it was “autonomously generated using Claude Code” and “Generated by: Claude (Anthropic)” (p. 34). This is **not acceptable** for a serious scholarly submission in its current form. Journals require clear authorship, responsibility, and typically disclosure statements rather than “generated by” claims. Even if this is an internal note, it must be removed/replaced with standard authorship and transparency statements.

---

# 2. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY (CRITICAL)

### (a) Standard errors
- **PASS.** Key coefficients include SEs in parentheses (e.g., Table 2; Table 3; Table 5; Table 6; Table 4 SA event study). Dynamic effects include SEs and/or CIs.

### (b) Significance testing
- **PASS.** The paper conducts inference (t-stats implicitly, stars, and discussion). Some claims about “statistically indistinguishable from zero” are appropriate.

### (c) Confidence intervals
- **PASS for the main CS-DiD result.** Table 3 and text provide 95% CIs (e.g., overall ATT CI [−1.414, 0.334]).

### (d) Sample sizes
- **PASS with caveats.** N is reported for the main regressions (357; 356).  
- However, in staggered DiD/event studies, *effective sample sizes vary by event time and cohort*; the paper does not report cohort-by-event cell counts (or the number of states contributing to each event time). For transparency, a top journal will expect a table/plot of **support** (how many treated units identify each dynamic coefficient).

### (e) DiD with staggered adoption
- **PASS in principle.** The use of Callaway–Sant’Anna (2021) is appropriate and avoids the classic TWFE bias. You also report SA and TWFE and acknowledge TWFE issues.
- **But**: the CS-DiD identifying variation is coming from **only 16 states (cohorts 2016–2021)**, because early adopters are “always-treated” in your panel and the 2015 cohort has no pre-period (Appendix Table 7; also discussed in Data section). This is a **major power and external-validity limitation** and should be front-and-center, not buried.

### (f) RDD requirements
- Not applicable (no RDD).

**Bottom line on methodology**: The paper is not “unpublishable” on inference grounds—your inference is present and broadly correct. The bigger problem is not *statistical procedure* but *research design adequacy for the question*, data aggregation/dilution, and unresolved confounding threats (next sections).

# 3. IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY

### Credibility
The basic idea—staggered state MW adoption and young-adult living arrangements—is reasonable. However, credibility is limited by several design issues that are not fully addressed:

1. **Outcome dilution / weak first stage (conceptually)**  
   Your outcome is the **share of all 18–34** living with parents (Table B09021). Minimum wages affect a relatively small share of this population (and even spillovers likely affect a minority). This creates a severe attenuation problem: a true effect among low-wage 18–34s could easily be washed out. This is not a “minor limitation”—it likely dominates interpretation.

2. **Policy endogeneity and omitted time-varying confounders**  
   You correctly note endogeneity concerns (pp. 14–15), but the paper does not convincingly address them. State MW changes correlate with a bundle of time-varying factors:
   - housing supply constraints and rent growth,
   - local economic booms,
   - other redistributive policies (EITC supplements, Medicaid expansion, housing policy, etc.).
   
   Your approach is essentially “state FE + year FE + pretrends look ok.” For a top journal, that is not enough given how politically and economically patterned MW adoption is.

3. **COVID-era complications with missing 2020**
   You make a reasonable point about CS-DiD’s universal base period (p. 13). Still, the missing 2020 creates:
   - awkward “event time” support for the 2021 cohort (no e = −1),
   - awkward treatment-year observability for the 2020 cohort (first post observed in 2021).
   
   This is not fatal, but you need much clearer exposition of **which cohorts identify which event times** and how missing 2020 affects dynamic interpretation.

4. **Never-treated states may not be valid controls**
   Your never-treated set is disproportionately Southern/Midwestern and systematically different in housing markets, demographics, and long-run household formation trends (Figure 2 shows level differences). State FE absorb levels, but differential trends remain plausible. You attempt not-yet-treated controls (Table 5), but it becomes very noisy. A top journal would expect stronger diagnostics and alternative designs.

### Assumptions discussion
- Parallel trends is discussed and an event study is presented (Table 3; Figure 3). That’s necessary.
- However, you should provide:
  - a **joint pretrend test** with a reported p-value (you mention a Wald test in Appendix B.1 but not the statistic/p-value),
  - **support counts by event time**,
  - stronger sensitivity analysis. HonestDiD “did not converge” (p. 31; Appendix B.2). For a top journal, “it didn’t converge” is not an acceptable endpoint—you need to (i) fix it, (ii) use an alternative sensitivity framework, or (iii) explain precisely why it cannot be implemented and provide some bounding/power logic anyway.

### Placebos / robustness
- Strengths: placebo outcome (Table 5), alternative thresholds, alternative control group, dropping 2021, pre-pandemic only.
- Missing/insufficient:
  - **Population weighting** (see below).
  - **Accounting for ACS sampling error / MOE** (see below).
  - **Alternative treatment codings** beyond a binary threshold (continuous MW level; interactions with baseline “bite”; or Cengiz-style bunching/ripple exposure measures).
  - **Local minimum wages**: many states have city/county MWs that may affect your “never-treated” controls, attenuating treatment contrasts. At minimum, discuss contamination; ideally incorporate local MW exposure.

### Do conclusions follow?
The conclusion “no meaningful shifts” is too strong relative to what you estimate. With ATT = −0.54 pp and SE 0.45, your 95% CI allows effects up to about **−1.4 pp**. Given outcome dilution, that could correspond to a sizable effect among the exposed subgroup. The correct conclusion is closer to:

- “We detect no effect on the *overall 18–34 parental co-residence share* at the state level, and we can rule out effects larger than about X pp on this aggregate outcome.”

You should add **minimum detectable effects (MDEs)** and interpret nulls as *power-limited*.

# 4. LITERATURE (missing references + BibTeX)

### What you do well
- Correctly cites modern staggered DiD: Callaway–Sant’Anna; Goodman-Bacon; Sun–Abraham; de Chaisemartin–D’Haultfœuille; Rambachan–Roth.
- Reasonable MW core: Dube; Cengiz et al.; Neumark–Wascher; Manning.
- Living arrangements: Kaplan; Dettling–Hsu; Fry (Pew).

### Key missing references (high priority)

#### (i) Event-study/DiD implementation alternatives (important for credibility)
You should cite and (ideally) implement at least one additional modern estimator beyond CS and SA, especially given SA pretrend problems and HonestDiD nonconvergence.

```bibtex
@article{BorusyakJaravelSpiess2021,
  author  = {Borusyak, Kirill and Jaravel, Xavier and Spiess, Jann},
  title   = {Revisiting Event Study Designs: Robust and Efficient Estimation},
  journal = {American Economic Review},
  year    = {2021},
  volume  = {111},
  number  = {4},
  pages   = {1251--1283}
}
```

Why relevant: widely used imputation/event-study approach that often behaves well with staggered adoption and clarifies identifying variation.

#### (ii) Minimum wage research design guidance / best practices
```bibtex
@article{AllegrettoDubeReichZipperer2017,
  author  = {Allegretto, Sylvia and Dube, Arindrajit and Reich, Michael and Zipperer, Ben},
  title   = {Credible Research Designs for Minimum Wage Studies},
  journal = {ILR Review},
  year    = {2017},
  volume  = {70},
  number  = {3},
  pages   = {559--592}
}
```

Why relevant: sets expectations for credible identification in MW studies; helps you justify control groups and address policy endogeneity.

#### (iii) MW employment dynamics / longer-run adjustments (context for household formation)
```bibtex
@article{MeerWest2016,
  author  = {Meer, Jonathan and West, Jeremy},
  title   = {Effects of the Minimum Wage on Employment Dynamics},
  journal = {Journal of Human Resources},
  year    = {2016},
  volume  = {51},
  number  = {2},
  pages   = {500--522}
}
```

Why relevant: household formation may respond to longer-run earnings/employment trajectories, not just levels.

#### (iv) Strong, quasi-experimental MW evidence on worker trajectories
Your paper leans heavily on Dube/Cengiz; a top-journal audience will expect engagement with “trajectory” evidence and recession context.

I recommend citing Clemens & Wither (AER 2019). I’m not including pages because I do not want to guess them inaccurately, but you should add the correct bibliographic details:

```bibtex
@article{ClemensWither2019,
  author  = {Clemens, Jeffrey and Wither, Michael},
  title   = {The Minimum Wage and the Great Recession: Evidence of Effects on the Employment and Income Trajectories of Low-Skilled Workers},
  journal = {American Economic Review},
  year    = {2019},
  volume  = {109},
  number  = {4}
}
```

Why relevant: connects MW policy to income/employment paths, plausibly linked to household formation.

### Closely related domain literature to add
Your “household formation” framing would be stronger with more U.S. empirical work on living arrangements and macro conditions (beyond a single unpublished Matsudaira cite). You should add key Census/ACS or peer-reviewed pieces on young adult co-residence cyclicality and housing affordability constraints. (You already cite Lee & Painter 2018; expand around that.)

# 5. WRITING QUALITY (CRITICAL)

### (a) Prose vs bullets
- **PASS**: Intro/Results/Discussion are paragraphs.
- Minor issue: there is some “report-like” writing in Results/Robustness (pp. 18–31) with repetitive “This is robust to…” sentences. For a top journal, you need a sharper narrative synthesis rather than checklist-style robustness prose.

### (b) Narrative flow
- The Introduction has a good motivation and stakes (rising co-residence, policy relevance).
- The paper’s arc is currently: motivation → method → null → robustness → interpretation.
- What’s missing is a compelling *ex ante* reason to expect detectable state-level aggregate effects, and a stronger articulation of what is learned from the null beyond “MW doesn’t matter for this.” A top outlet will ask: **What new mechanism or constraint is illuminated?** Right now, the story is plausible but not distinctive.

### (c) Sentence quality
- Generally clear and competent.
- Too many sentences are “technical report” style. More signposting would help: at the start of each results subsection, state the economic question and what would be implied by each sign/magnitude.

### (d) Accessibility
- Technical terms are mostly defined (CS-DiD; staggered adoption).
- Magnitudes are contextualized somewhat (pp. 18–19). Add more: relate estimated effects to plausible moving costs, rent-to-income ratios, and/or to changes over time in co-residence.

### (e) Figures/tables
- Mostly self-explanatory with notes.
- For top journals: harmonize design, reduce clutter, add “N cohorts contributing” to event-study figures, ensure colorblind-safe.

**Major non-negotiable writing/professional issue**: The “autonomously generated” disclosure (p. 34) makes the manuscript look non-serious as an academic contribution. This must be replaced with standard authorship, contributions, data/code availability, and (if relevant) AI assistance disclosure consistent with journal policies.

# 6. CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS (how to make it top-journal-impactful)

### A. Move from state aggregates to microdata (most important)
To answer household formation credibly, you likely need **ACS microdata (PUMS)** (or CPS/ASEC) and estimate effects on:
- low-education, low-wage, or low predicted-wage young adults;
- those in the labor force / employed;
- renters vs non-renters;
- metropolitan area residents (matching MW policy and housing markets more tightly).

This would directly address your own “dilution” explanation (pp. 32–33). Without this, the null is hard to interpret.

### B. Improve treatment measurement (“dose” and exposure)
Binary “MW gap ≥ $1” is arbitrary and discards policy intensity. For a stronger design:
- Use continuous MW levels and/or event-study by **policy size bins**.
- Use a “bite” measure: MW / median wage (or MW relative to the 10th percentile wage) to capture exposure.
- Consider spillover bands (Cengiz et al. approach) if using micro wages; at state aggregate level, you cannot validate “ripple” channels.

### C. Weighting and sampling error
You should report:
- **Population-weighted** estimates (weight by 18–34 population) to interpret as national average impacts.
- Sensitivity to weighting scheme (unweighted vs weighted).
- Discussion/handling of ACS sampling variability. At minimum, show that results are robust to weighting by inverse variance if MOEs are available.

### D. Address time-varying confounds more seriously
The statement that unemployment rates were unavailable because the BLS API returned NA (p. 10; Appendix A.1) is not acceptable for a top-journal paper. You must:
- retrieve unemployment from alternative sources (FRED/LAUS files), or
- include other labor-market controls (employment-to-population, wages, GDP), or
- adopt a design less reliant on the assumption that these do not differentially trend.

Even if controls are imperfect, showing robustness to including them is expected.

### E. Pre-trends and sensitivity analysis must be strengthened
- Fix HonestDiD nonconvergence or provide an alternative partial-identification/sensitivity approach.
- Provide support counts by event time and cohort.
- Given SA pretrend violations (Table 4; pp. 25–26), explain why SA disagrees with CS pretrends (you start to), and show additional diagnostics to reassure the reader.

### F. Consider contamination from local minimum wages
Your “never-treated” states may include cities with local MWs. If so, your control group is partially treated, biasing toward zero. At minimum:
- document local MW prevalence by state-year,
- run robustness excluding states with prominent local MWs (or include a control for local MW coverage).

### G. Clarify estimand and policy relevance
Right now, the paper’s estimand is “effect of crossing MW ≥ $1 above federal.” Policy readers care about:
- $10 → $12,
- $12 → $15,
- indexing regimes,
- large discrete jumps.
You should reframe around “typical MW increase magnitudes” and show effects per $1 (with credible staggered methods, not just TWFE linear gap).

### H. Make the contribution sharper
A top general-interest journal will ask: why does this paper matter beyond documenting a null?
Possible angles:
- household formation is dominated by housing costs rather than entry-level wages;
- MW effects show up in consumption but not in discrete living arrangement transitions;
- MW increases may raise rents (as you discuss) and offset wage gains—test this explicitly (first-stage: MW → rents; then reduced form: MW → co-residence; possibly IV-style decomposition, with care).

# 7. OVERALL ASSESSMENT

### Key strengths
- Uses an appropriate modern staggered DiD estimator (CS-DiD) rather than relying on TWFE.
- Reports SEs, CIs, placebo outcome, alternative thresholds, alternative control group, and COVID exclusions.
- Clear motivation and generally readable prose.

### Critical weaknesses (top-journal level)
1. **Outcome and aggregation likely wash out the relevant margin** (18–34 state aggregate). This makes the null hard to interpret.
2. **Identifying variation is thin** (only 16 states contribute to CS-DiD ATT). Power and external validity are limited.
3. **Time-varying confounding remains a major threat**; the “unemployment API failed” limitation is not credible in a top submission and must be fixed.
4. **Sensitivity analysis is incomplete** (HonestDiD nonconvergence; limited diagnostics on support).
5. **Professional/authorship presentation is not acceptable** (“autonomously generated by Claude” disclosure).

### What would make it publishable (in principle)
A serious revision would (i) move to microdata and focus on exposed subgroups, (ii) improve treatment/exposure measurement, (iii) strengthen identification and sensitivity analysis, and (iv) present results with clearer policy-relevant estimands and a sharper conceptual contribution.

DECISION: REJECT AND RESUBMIT
