\item \textit{Notes:} CMS State Drug Utilization Data (SDUD) was unavailable at the time of analysis due to API changes at data.medicaid.gov. Results will be populated when the SDUD data becomes accessible. The SDUD covers Medicaid beneficiaries, not commercially insured patients directly targeted by copay caps. Column (1) uses log insulin prescriptions as the dependent variable with TWFE. Column (2) uses prescription levels. Column (3) applies the Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator to log prescriptions. Standard errors clustered at the state level. Vermont excluded.
