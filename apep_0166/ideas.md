# Research Ideas (Revision of apep_0157)

This is a revision, not a new paper. The research question is inherited from the parent paper (apep_0157).

## Idea 1: Age-Restricted Diabetes Mortality and Insulin Copay Caps

**Policy:** State insulin copay cap laws (26 states, 2019-2024)
**Outcome:** Working-age (25-64) diabetes mortality from CDC WONDER
**Identification:** Staggered DiD with Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator
**Why it's novel:** Addresses outcome dilution (the primary criticism of the parent paper) by restricting to the age group most affected by state copay cap laws
**Feasibility check:** Confirmed: CDC WONDER provides age-restricted mortality data; staggered variation across 17 treated states; 20+ years pre-treatment data; fills the 2018-2019 gap

## Revision Rationale

The parent paper (apep_0157) received MAJOR REVISION from all three external reviewers, with every reviewer identifying **outcome dilution** as the primary limitation. This revision directly addresses that concern.
