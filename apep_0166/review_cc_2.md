## Changes Since Round 1

The following issues from Round 1 have been addressed:
- Wild bootstrap SE notation: Added footnote markers ($^{\dagger}$) in Tables 4 and 12 with explanatory notes
- Table 5 heterogeneity N: Added clarification that N varies because each column uses different treated-state subsets plus all never-treated states
- COVID sensitivity table: Populated with actual regression results (was placeholder)
- "22 years" corrected to "25 years" in Introduction
- Placebo table: Added note explaining sign differences across estimators are expected under null

## Remaining Issues

No fatal issues remain. Minor points:

1. The tabularray table width warning for Table 5 should be resolved (cosmetic, not blocking).
2. The COVID year indicators specification producing identical results to baseline should be briefly noted in the discussion of Table 15 (already noted in table footnote).

## Assessment

The paper is now ready for external review. All tables populated, all references resolved, internal consistency verified.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
