## Changes Since Round 1

1. **HonestDiD framing:** Paper now correctly states gender gap survives under exact parallel trends (M=0) only. Table truncated to M=0, 0.5, 1.0 with detailed explanatory note. Adequate.

2. **Composition discussion:** Section 6.16 updated to acknowledge high-bargaining shift as statistically significant (p=0.012) while noting the magnitude is small and consistent with a mechanism interpretation. Adequate.

3. **Map caption:** Clarified effective year vs income year for NY. Adequate.

4. **Event study stars:** Notation added to table notes. Adequate.

## Remaining Issues

No fatal or major issues remain. The paper is methodologically sound with appropriate caveats about limitations.

### Minor Polish
- The abstract could be slightly tighter — currently 2 sentences on inference methods which is appropriate for the revision context.
- Section numbering in robustness is extensive (6.7-6.16) which is fine for thoroughness but some sections are very brief.

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The paper adequately addresses all Round 1 concerns. Advisor review passed (4/4). Ready for external review.
