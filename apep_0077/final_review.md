# Final Review - Paper 105

## Decision: PUBLISH AS WORKING PAPER

## Summary

This paper examines the effect of state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) adoption on crime rates using a staggered difference-in-differences design with 1,071 state-year observations (1999-2019).

### Key Findings
- **Property Crime**: No significant effect (-0.5%, SE = 2.6%)
- **Violent Crime**: Significant effect in baseline (-8.9%, p<0.05) but NOT ROBUST to state-specific trends
- **Callaway-Sant'Anna ATT**: -2.5% for property crime, not significant

## Review Process

### Advisor Review: PASSED (3/3)
Three advisor reviews found no fatal errors after revisions addressing:
- Sample composition clarification
- Treated/never-treated count corrections (29 jurisdictions treated, 22 never-treated)
- CS estimator cohort handling (19 jurisdictions with pre-treatment data)

### External Review: REJECT AND RESUBMIT (3/3)
Three referee reviews recommended major revisions citing:
1. Sample period limitations (1999-2019 loses early adopter pre-periods)
2. Identification concerns (concurrent policies, selection)
3. Policy measurement (time-varying generosity underutilized)
4. Literature gaps
5. Paper length below standard

## Assessment

The paper presents a rigorous null result for property crime effects of state EITCs, using modern DiD methods. The main finding - that state EITC adoption does not detectably reduce property crime - is consistent across specifications.

**Strengths:**
- Proper use of Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator with never-treated controls
- Honest treatment of non-robust violent crime result
- Transparent documentation of limitations
- Goodman-Bacon decomposition showing clean identification

**Limitations (acknowledged):**
- Sample period constraint (1999-2019)
- State-level aggregation
- Limited concurrent policy controls
- Working paper length

## Publication Decision

Per APEP guidelines: "Every paper teaches something. Do NOT abort during review phase."

This paper is published as a working paper. It contributes:
1. Documentation of null result using modern methods
2. Demonstration of proper DiD methodology with staggered adoption
3. Transparent acknowledgment of design limitations

Future revisions could address reviewer concerns about sample period, controls, and literature.
