Without an acquisition step (URL download, checksum, version pinning), the crime data provenance is incomplete and results are not fully reproducible/auditable.: crime_raw <- read_csv(file.path(DATA_DIR, \"state_crime_corgis.csv\"), show_col_types = FALSE)",

      "evidence": "The manuscript describes constructing a state-year policy database with adoption year and credit rate (and notes states change rates over time). However, the code builds a panel where the generosity variable for all treated years is a single 2019 rate (eitc_pct_2019) carried back to earlier years. This can materially mis-measure the continuous treatment intensity and any dose-response results (e.g., Table 'EITC Generosity (%)' regressions), and it can also affect binary treatment if adoption year is correct but generosity is time-invariant when it should vary. This is a substantive mismatch between the described policy variation over time and what is implemented.: # Note: Generosity may change over time - using 2019 values for cross-section\n...\n~state_abbr, ~state_name, ~eitc_adopted, ~eitc_pct_2019, ~refundable,\n...\n# Continuous treatment: Generosity (% of federal), 0 for non-EITC states\neitc_generosity = if_else(has_eitc == 1, coalesce(eitc_pct_2019, 0), 0),",

      "evidence": "Minnesota and Wisconsin EITC generosity is manually imputed with approximate constants. This is not inherently improper, but it is an ad hoc transformation of key treatment intensity with no data citation or sensitivity analysis. Because generosity is later used as a continuous regressor, these imputations can influence estimates, especially given the already time-invariant generosity construction.: eitc_pct_2019 = case_when(\n      state_abbr == \"MN\" ~ 25,  # Approximate\n      state_abbr == \"WI\" ~ 11,  # Approximate average\n      TRUE ~ eitc_pct_2019\n    )",

This creates a transcription/tampering risk: the PDF could reflect numbers not produced by the code actually run. If the workflow is intended to use modelsummary/etable outputs, the manuscript should \\input{} the generated .tex tables or use a reproducible weaving approach.: I find no statistically significant effect of state EITC adoption on property crime (coefficient: $-$0.5\\%, SE: 2.6\\%).\nI also document a significant 8.9\\% reduction in violent crime in the baseline specification (p $<$ 0.05), ...\n...\nState EITC & $-$0.005 & 0.010 & $-$0.008 & $-$0.017 & $-$0.089** \\\\\n           & (0.026) & (0.029) & (0.028) & (0.063) & (0.039) \\\\",

In addition, `01_fetch_data.R` does not implement the policy database described in the manuscript (state adoption year and time-varying credit rates); instead it appears to build a panel with a fixed/incorrect \u201cgenerosity\u201d measure, creating a high-risk mismatch between the documented methodology and what is actually estimated.",
