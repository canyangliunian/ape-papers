## General Response

We thank the reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback. The concerns raised are legitimate and reflect the high standards expected at top journals. We acknowledge that this paper, in its current form, is best characterized as a working paper contribution rather than a top-journal submission.

## Response to Common Concerns

### Re: Sample Period (1999-2019)

Reviewers correctly note that truncating the sample to 1999-2019 forces early adopters to be "always treated" with no pre-period. This is a limitation of the current data source (CORGIS state crime dataset). We have:
- Explicitly noted this limitation in the methodology
- Documented which cohorts are included/excluded from CS estimation
- Framed findings as applicable to 2000-2019 adopters only

### Re: Policy Measurement

The continuous treatment specification (Table 3) uses state EITC generosity as a percentage of federal credit. However, the reviewers correctly note that time-varying generosity changes are not fully exploited. This is acknowledged as a limitation.

### Re: Identification

We agree that state-level DiD with minimal controls faces identification challenges. The paper documents patterns consistent with parallel trends for property crime and acknowledges that violent crime effects are not robust to trend controls.

### Re: Literature

The reviewers have provided valuable references that would strengthen future revisions. The current bibliography covers core methodology papers but could be expanded.

## Conclusion

This paper is published as an APEP working paper documenting a rigorously-estimated null result for state EITC effects on property crime. The limitations identified by reviewers are acknowledged, and future revisions could address them.
