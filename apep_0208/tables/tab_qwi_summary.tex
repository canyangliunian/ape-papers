\textit{Notes:} Data from the Census Bureau's Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI), aggregated to the state-quarter level. Treated states enacted salary transparency laws; control states are never-treated. Pre-treatment means computed over quarters prior to each state's treatment date. Earnings are average quarterly earnings per worker. Hiring rate = hires/employment; separation rate = separations/employment; net job creation rate = (hires $-$ separations)/employment. Gender earnings gap = male average earnings $-$ female average earnings.
