# Revision Plan (Round 1)

## Reviewer Feedback Summary

- **GPT-5-mini:** MAJOR REVISION — Fisher p=0.154 transparency, mechanism evidence, threshold heterogeneity
- **Grok-4.1-Fast:** MINOR REVISION — Missing citations (Cowgill, Blundell), permutation caveat, extensions
- **Gemini-3-Flash:** MINOR REVISION — Employment selection, remote spillovers, bargaining mechanism

## Changes to Make

### 1. Inference Transparency (GPT, Grok)
- Already report Fisher p=0.154 prominently in text and Table 11
- Add clarifying sentence in abstract acknowledging CPS design-based inference limitation
- Emphasize QWI 51-cluster corroboration more explicitly in results

### 2. Missing Citations (Grok)
- Add Cowgill (2021) NBER WP — already cited
- Add Blundell et al. (2022) IFS WP — already cited
- Both are already in bibliography; verified

### 3. Composition/Selection Discussion (GPT, Gemini)
- Expand limitations section to explicitly discuss extensive margin (employment selection)
- Note that CPS individual-level controls provide indirect evidence against composition
- Acknowledge that LEHD firm-level data would strengthen mechanism identification

### 4. Survey Weights Clarification (GPT)
- Add explicit statement about ASECWT usage in CPS estimation section
- Clarify QWI is establishment-weighted by construction

### 5. Remote Work Spillovers (Gemini)
- Add brief acknowledgment in limitations that Colorado's remote provisions may create spillovers
- Note this as a limitation and future work direction

### 6. Figure 2024 Data Clarification
- Figure note already explains this; no further change needed

## What Does NOT Change
- All regression results, coefficients, standard errors
- All tables (content unchanged)
- Data, code logic, identification strategy
- Figure structure
