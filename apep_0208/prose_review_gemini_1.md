# Section-by-Section Review

## The Opening
**Verdict:** **Hooks immediately.**
The opening line—"When employers must reveal what they pay, who benefits and what breaks?"—is pure Shleifer. It frames the paper not as a technical exercise in difference-in-differences, but as a fundamental inquiry into market mechanics. Within two paragraphs, the reader knows exactly what is at stake (information vs. commitment), the scale of the policy (80 million workers), and the central tension of the results.

## Introduction
**Verdict:** **Shleifer-ready.**
The arc is professional and disciplined. It moves from a high-level puzzle to the specific "fragmentary" nature of existing literature.
*   **Strengths:** The preview of results is refreshingly specific. You don't just find "effects"; you find "women’s wages rise 4.0–5.6 percentage points."
*   **Suggestions:** The "contribution" paragraph (bottom of page 2) is a bit humble. Instead of "This paper fills that gap," consider a Glaeser-style push: "By observing both the worker’s paycheck and the firm’s hiring desk, I can finally distinguish between equity gains and market efficiency."

## Background / Institutional Context
**Verdict:** **Vivid and necessary.**
Section 3 does a great job of distinguishing "ex ante" disclosure from "ex post" reporting. This isn't just a legal distinction; it's a conceptual one.
*   **Prose Check:** "Colorado's Equal Pay for Equal Work Act... was the first U.S. law..." is a solid anchor. The discussion of "good faith estimates" vs. "precise pay scales" makes the policy concrete. The reader *sees* the job posting.

## Data
**Verdict:** **Reads as narrative.**
The author successfully weaves the data into a story of "complementarity."
*   **Glaeser/Katz touch:** You describe the QWI not just as a database, but as "administrative employer records... from both sides of the labor market." 
*   **Improvement:** In Section 4.4, the discussion of summary statistics is a bit dry. Instead of "Treated states have higher quarterly earnings ($5,185 vs. $4,650)," try: "The laws took hold first in wealthier, more educated states—coasts and mountain hubs where the gender gap sat at 43 cents on the dollar."

## Empirical Strategy
**Verdict:** **Clear to non-specialists.**
The logic is intuitive: "We compare counties that were more exposed...". 
*   **Shleifer Test:** Paragraph 1 of Section 5.1 is a model of clarity. It doesn't hide behind Greek letters. It tells us that the assumption is "fundamentally untestable" but "supported by pre-trends." This honesty builds trust.

## Results
**Verdict:** **Tells a story.**
This is the strongest part of the prose. You are telling the reader what they *learned*.
*   **Excellent Sentence:** "The concordance across a household survey and administrative records... is the paper's strongest evidence." (Page 15). This is the "inevitability" Shleifer strives for.
*   **Katz touch:** On page 16, the discussion of "economically informative" nulls is excellent. You explain that a 0.8 percentage point bound is "well below the magnitudes observed during actual labor market disruptions." This gives the reader a yardstick.

## Discussion / Conclusion
**Verdict:** **Resonates.**
The conclusion is punchy and reframes the paper.
*   **Shleifer-esque Ending:** "When workers know what jobs pay, the people who benefit most are those who knew the least." It’s a perfect distillation.
*   **Policy Implications:** Section 8.4 is bold. "The equity-efficiency trade-off turns out to be remarkably favorable." This is the "human stakes" Glaeser would want.

## Overall Writing Assessment

*   **Current level:** **Top-journal ready.** The prose is exceptionally clean, disciplined, and focused on the economics rather than the math.
*   **Greatest strength:** **Symmetry and Logic.** The paper sets up three theoretical channels (Table 1) and systematically knocks two of them down while supporting the third. It feels "inevitable."
*   **Greatest weakness:** **Passive Voice in Robustness.** Section 7 starts to slip into standard academic "passive-speak" ("C-S ATT is stable," "Lee bounds confirm"). 
*   **Shleifer test:** **Yes.** A smart non-economist would understand the first three pages without effort.

### Top 5 Concrete Improvements

1.  **Eliminate Throat-clearing:** (Page 24) "Several limitations warrant discussion" $\rightarrow$ "I address five limitations of the current design."
2.  **Active Voice in Result Narration:** (Page 13) "Table 6 tells the central story" $\rightarrow$ "The gender gap narrows." Use the table to *support* the sentence, don't make the table the *subject* of the sentence.
3.  **Vivid Transitions:** (Page 10) "6. Results" is a boring header. Consider: "6. Did the Market Break? Results on Wages and Flows."
4.  **Katz-style Result Grounding:** When mentioning the 4-6pp narrowing, add a sentence: "For a woman earning the sample mean, this represents an extra $150 in her monthly take-home pay—enough to cover [utility/gas/etc.]."
5.  **Roadmap Pruning:** (Page 3) The paragraph "The paper proceeds as follows..." is standard but unnecessary given your excellent section transitions. Consider deleting or shortening it to one sentence.

**Final Thought:** This is a masterclass in modern economic writing. It treats the reader's time as the scarcest resource in the model.
