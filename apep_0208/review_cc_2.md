## 1. Summary

This paper investigates salary transparency laws---state mandates requiring employers to include compensation ranges in job postings---using a staggered difference-in-differences design across eight U.S. states. The empirical approach combines CPS ASEC microdata (614,625 person-year observations, 2014--2024) with Census QWI administrative records (2,603 state-quarter observations, 2012Q1--2024Q4). The paper's central claim is that transparency equalizes information rather than committing employers or triggering costly adjustment. This is supported by three findings: a precisely estimated null effect on aggregate wages (CPS ATT = -0.004; QWI ATT = -0.001), a significant narrowing of the gender wage gap (CPS DDD = 4.0--5.6 pp across specifications in Table 5; QWI DDD = 6.1 pp in Table 6 Panel C), and null effects on all five labor market flow variables (Table 7). The paper frames these findings through a conceptual framework (Table 1) that maps channels to predicted outcomes across three margins.

## 2. Methodology Assessment

The econometric approach is solid and up to date. The Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator correctly addresses the staggered timing problem. The triple-difference design with state-by-year fixed effects (Table 5, Column 4: 0.043, p < 0.01) provides the cleanest identification of the gender-specific effect by absorbing all aggregate state-year variation and isolating within-state-year gender differences. The dual-dataset strategy is well motivated and appropriately executed, with the QWI providing 51 clusters for inference versus the CPS's 8 treated states. Fisher randomization inference, HonestDiD, Lee bounds, SDID, and leave-one-out analysis represent a thorough robustness battery. The paper does not cut corners methodologically.

## 3. Strengths

**Novel policy setting with cross-dataset triangulation.** The paper studies mandatory salary posting in job listings---a stronger treatment than the "right-to-ask" laws in Cullen and Pakzad-Hurson (2023) or the firm-level internal disclosure studied by Baker et al. (2023). The ex ante versus ex post distinction drawn in Section 3 is economically important: posting ranges in job ads affects the search and matching process itself, not just incumbent renegotiation. That this ex ante intervention produces larger estimated effects (4--6 pp) than Denmark's ex post reporting mandate (~2 pp from Bennedsen et al. 2022) or the UK's disclosure (~2 pp from Blundell et al. 2022) is a meaningful finding, discussed appropriately in Section 8.2.

**The predictions table as an organizing device.** Table 1 is an effective piece of economic argumentation. By specifying ex ante what each channel predicts across three margins (aggregate wages, gender gap, flows), the paper creates a framework for pattern-matching across results. The observed pattern---{0, -, 0, 0, 0}---maps cleanly to information equalization and is inconsistent with employer commitment (which predicts aggregate wage compression) and costly adjustment (which predicts spiking flows). This is a more persuasive form of mechanism identification than simply testing one channel at a time.

## 4. Weaknesses

**W1: The conceptual framework oversimplifies channel interactions.** Table 1 treats information equalization, employer commitment, and costly adjustment as mutually exclusive, but in practice they likely operate simultaneously. Transparency could simultaneously equalize information (narrowing the gender gap) and impose commitment costs (compressing wages for high earners), producing an aggregate null that masks two offsetting forces rather than indicating that commitment is absent. The paper's Section 8.1 discussion argues that commitment "should compress the entire wage distribution," but this need not be true if commitment costs are heterogeneous across firm types. A more nuanced framing would acknowledge that the aggregate null is consistent with multiple channel combinations, not just "pure information equalization."

**W2: The magnitude comparison across studies requires more careful interpretation.** Section 8.2 compares the 4--6 pp CPS estimate to Denmark (~2 pp), Baker et al. (~3 pp), and the UK (~2 pp), arguing that job-posting transparency is "among the most potent transparency interventions." But the comparison is apples-to-oranges in several ways. Denmark's mandate affected all firms nationally (no within-country control group), Baker et al. studied a single firm, and the UK's reporting requirements are structurally different. The larger point estimate here may partly reflect the shorter post-treatment window (mean ~2 years) capturing initial adjustment rather than long-run equilibrium. If employers learn to post wider ranges or workers habituate to posted information, the long-run effect could be substantially smaller. The paper acknowledges the short window in Section 8.3, but the magnitude comparison in 8.2 is presented without this caveat.

**W3: The Fisher p = 0.154 for the CPS gender DDD warrants more economic (not just statistical) discussion.** The paper treats this primarily as an inferential nuisance caused by few clusters (Section 7.2). But there is a substantive interpretation: with only 5,000 permutations of 8 treated states among 51, the permutation test asks whether any random subset of 8 states would produce a gender DDD as large as 0.040. A p-value of 0.154 means roughly 1 in 7 random subsets does---which could reflect genuine heterogeneity in gender wage dynamics across states rather than a treatment effect. The paper's defense relies heavily on QWI confirmation, but as noted in the methodology review, the QWI observes the same eight treated states, so the "independence" is partial.

**W4: The null dynamism result may reflect measurement limitations rather than absence of effects.** The QWI measures aggregate state-level hiring, separations, and job creation. If transparency causes reallocation within states---workers sorting across firms within the same state, or firms adjusting internal pay bands without changing headcount---the QWI would not detect it. The paper's claim that "labor markets absorb salary transparency without observable disruption" (Section 6.3) is supported only for aggregate state-level flows. More granular evidence (firm-level hiring patterns, within-industry reallocation) would be needed to definitively rule out allocative effects. The comparison to the Great Recession (p. 19) is striking but somewhat misleading---transparency is a much smaller shock, and the relevant benchmark should be other information interventions, not macroeconomic crises.

## 5. Suggestions

1. **Soften the mechanism identification language.** The paper currently states the data are "inconsistent with employer commitment or costly adjustment operating as dominant forces" (Section 1). The qualifier "dominant" is doing important work but appears only in the introduction and Section 8.1. Throughout the rest of the paper (including the abstract), the framing is more categorical: "transparency equalizes information without disrupting labor markets." Revise to consistently acknowledge that the observed pattern is consistent with information equalization as the primary channel, while acknowledging that commitment costs may operate at a smaller scale.

2. **Add a dynamic effects discussion to the magnitude comparison.** When comparing to Bennedsen et al. and Baker et al. in Section 8.2, note that those studies observe longer post-treatment windows. The initial impact of a new information disclosure may overstate the long-run equilibrium effect if employers and workers adapt. This is particularly relevant given that the cohort-specific ATTs (Table A.5) show the 2024 cohort---with only one post-treatment year---producing the weakest estimate.

3. **Discuss within-state reallocation.** The claim that transparency causes no labor market disruption is stronger than the evidence supports. The QWI can detect aggregate state-level changes but not within-state reallocation. Add a paragraph to Section 8.3 (Limitations) acknowledging that the null dynamism finding rules out macro disruption but cannot speak to micro-level sorting. Linked employer-employee data (mentioned briefly at the end of Section 8.3) would be the appropriate test.

4. **Provide economic interpretation of the gender DDD magnitude.** The paper reports that 4--6 pp represents "roughly half the residual gender gap" and "approximately 17--30% of the total raw gap." These benchmarks are useful but abstract. A back-of-the-envelope calculation of implied dollar gains---using the mean female wage in treated states ($28.42 for all workers in Table A.2; the female mean is likely somewhat lower) and multiplying by the percentage effect---would make the magnitude more tangible for a policy audience.

5. **Expand the conceptual framework to address combined channels.** Table 1 could include a row for "Information equalization + modest commitment" that predicts {0 or small -, -, 0, 0, 0}---acknowledging that the aggregate null could reflect two channels partially offsetting. This would make the framework more honest without undermining the paper's core argument. It would also motivate future work on decomposing the aggregate null into component channels, perhaps using the variation in employer thresholds across states (mentioned in Section 8.3 but unexploited).

6. **Consider heterogeneity by law stringency.** The paper documents variation in employer thresholds (all employers vs. 4+ vs. 15+ vs. 50+), disclosure specificity, and enforcement mechanisms across states, but does not exploit this variation empirically. Even a simple split---states with universal coverage (CO, CT, NV, RI) versus states with thresholds (CA, WA, NY, HI)---could provide suggestive evidence on dose-response. With only 8 treated states this would be noisy, but the direction of the comparison would be informative.

## 6. Decision

**MINOR REVISION.** This is a well-executed paper studying an important and timely policy question. The dual-dataset design is a genuine methodological contribution, and the findings are substantively interesting. The main concerns are about framing: the mechanism identification is presented too categorically given the observational limitations, the magnitude comparisons need more careful qualification, and the null dynamism result is interpreted too broadly. These are issues of presentation and qualification, not fundamental threats to the core findings. With the suggested revisions, the paper would provide a balanced and persuasive account of what salary transparency laws accomplish.
