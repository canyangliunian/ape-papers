# Reply to Reviewers - Round 1

## Response to Gemini-3-Flash (Conditionally Accept)

We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment. We have addressed the suggestions:

**Missing literature (Iversen & Soskice 2019):**
> Added citation in Conclusion when discussing sorting mechanisms.

**Individual-level mechanism:**
> We acknowledge this as a limitation in Future Research section.

**Demographic interactions:**
> Noted as future research direction.

**Longer lag structure:**
> Added as future research suggestion in Conclusion.

## Response to Grok-4.1-Fast (Minor Revision)

**95% Confidence Intervals:**
> We have added explicit 95% CIs for the key within-CBSA estimate in both the Conclusion and Limitations sections (CI: [-0.006, 0.010]).

**Missing references (Chetty et al. 2014, Autor 2019, Kuziemko et al. 2021):**
> Added all three references to bibliography and cited appropriately.

**Event-study plot:**
> With only T=3, a traditional event study is not feasible. We discuss this limitation.

## Response to GPT-5-mini (Major Revision)

**Power calculations:**
> Added explicit discussion of minimum detectable effects (MDE ~0.015 pp at 80% power) in Limitations section and Conclusion.

**Measurement error/attenuation:**
> Added acknowledgment in Limitations that measurement error could attenuate within-CBSA estimates.

**Softened causal claims:**
> Revised Conclusion to state evidence is "more consistent with" sorting rather than definitively ruling out causation. Added explicit acknowledgment that we cannot exclude smaller effects.

**Missing methodological references:**
> Added Lee & Lemieux (2010) and Cameron, Gelbach & Miller (2008).

**Placebo tests:**
> Noted as limitation; pre-2016 voting data not available in our current dataset.

**Migration/sorting test:**
> Acknowledged as valuable future research in Discussion section.
