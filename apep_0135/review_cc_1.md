# Internal Review - Claude Code Round 1

**Date:** 2026-02-02

## Summary

This paper examines the relationship between technological obsolescence and populist voting across U.S. metropolitan areas. The main finding is that while there is a strong cross-sectional correlation, within-CBSA fixed effects and gains specifications show null effects, suggesting sorting rather than causation.

## Strengths

1. **Novel data**: Uses modal technology age data from Acemoglu et al. (2022), providing a fresh angle on economic determinants of populism
2. **Rigorous identification**: Tests multiple predictions distinguishing causal from sorting interpretations
3. **Clear writing**: Well-organized narrative with professional prose
4. **Transparent methodology**: All specifications include SEs, sample sizes, and robustness checks

## Issues Identified and Addressed

1. **Internal consistency**: Fixed coefficient reporting to match tables
2. **Missing references**: Added Iversen & Soskice, Chetty et al., Kuziemko & Washington, Lee & Lemieux, Cameron et al.
3. **Power discussion**: Added explicit acknowledgment of power limitations for within-CBSA tests
4. **Causal claims**: Softened language throughout to reflect uncertainty

## Verdict

Paper ready for external review after revisions implemented.
