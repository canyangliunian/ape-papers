## Synthesis of Round 1 Review

Round 1 identified key issues:
1. Paper under 25 pages
2. Missing RDD diagnostics (McCrary, bandwidth sensitivity)
3. Thin literature (9 citations)
4. Fundamental identification limitations (5 treated cantons)

## Assessment of Current State

The paper addresses a genuinely interesting policy question: does sub-national policy experience build support for federal action? The Swiss setting is well-suited to this question given its direct democracy and cantonal autonomy.

### What Works

1. **Honest treatment of limitations:** The paper correctly labels the spatial RDD as "exploratory" and acknowledges that language borders confound identification. This is the right approach given the design limitations.

2. **Clear null result:** The main finding (−1.8 pp, SE=1.9, p=0.35) is clearly communicated. The paper resists over-interpreting a noisy estimate.

3. **Language confounder well-documented:** The Röstigraben issue is thoroughly explained and addressed through language controls.

4. **Data sources are legitimate:** Real BFS/swissdd data, not simulated.

### Remaining Concerns

1. **Statistical power:** With only 5 treated cantons clustered at canton level, the effective sample for treatment identification is very small. A formal power calculation would help.

2. **RDD pooling issue:** Even labeled as "exploratory," the pooled RDD estimate mixes same-language and cross-language borders. A restricted estimate (same-language only) would be more interpretable.

3. **Mechanism speculation:** The discussion proposes several mechanisms (policy satiation, cost salience, perceived redundancy) but cannot test them with aggregate voting data.

## Recommendation

The paper is methodologically sound given its limitations and appropriately cautious in its claims. The main weakness is scope/depth rather than fundamental flaws.

**For top general-interest journal:** Not ready. Needs expanded analysis, deeper literature engagement, and ideally additional data (e.g., individual surveys).

**For field journal:** Publishable with revisions. The question is interesting, the data real, and the interpretation honest.

## Specific Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Add same-language border RDD:** Restrict to AG-ZH, AG-SO, BL-SO, GR-SG borders and report separately.

2. **Add bandwidth sensitivity:** Report estimates at 0.5×, 1×, 1.5×, 2× the MSE-optimal bandwidth.

3. **Expand literature:** Add 10-15 additional citations covering RDD methodology, Swiss referendum voting, and spatial discontinuity designs.

4. **Power calculation:** State the minimum detectable effect given N=26 cantons, 5 treated, canton-clustered SEs.

**DECISION: MINOR REVISION**

The paper can proceed to external review. Key issues have been acknowledged by the author. Remaining concerns are about scope/depth rather than fatal methodological flaws.
