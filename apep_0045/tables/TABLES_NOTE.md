# Tables Note

Tables are embedded directly in the LaTeX document (`paper.tex`) rather than as separate files.

The following tables are included in the paper:

1. **Table 1** - State Auto-IRA Program Details (launch dates, default rates, initial mandates)
2. **Table 2** - Phase-In Schedules for Major State Programs
3. **Table 3** - Summary Statistics: Private Sector Workers Ages 25-64
4. **Table 4** - Effect of Auto-IRA Mandates on Retirement Plan Coverage (main results)
5. **Table 5** - Treatment Effects by Adoption Cohort
6. **Table 6** - Robustness Checks
7. **Table 7** - Heterogeneity by Worker Characteristics

To regenerate tables, run `06_tables.R` which outputs formatted LaTeX table code.
