## Changes Since Round 1

The following issues have been addressed:
1. Figure colors now render correctly (legal vs illegal states distinguished)
2. THC figure shows cross-sectional data correctly labeled as 2018-2019
3. Alcohol time-of-day claims now match actual data (60-70% at night)
4. Alaska/CONUS geocoding definitions clarified
5. California legalization date corrected to 2017-01-01
6. Oregon's anomalous THC rate noted in figure caption
7. Drug "test record" terminology fixed to "drug record" throughout

## Remaining Minor Issues

1. The paper could benefit from a summary statistics appendix table
2. Some border figures have sparse data on the illegal side (acknowledged in text)

## Assessment

The paper has been substantially improved through multiple revision rounds. All fatal errors identified by GPT-5.2 and Gemini advisors have been addressed. The paper now presents consistent terminology, accurate dates, and properly-labeled figures.

The paper is ready for external review.
