      "score": 74,
      "verdict": "PURSUE",
      "strengths": "High policy salience (Medicaid vs private payment at delivery) and extremely large natality microdata gives strong precision. The age-26 cutoff is plausibly exogenous and directly tied to the insurance mechanism you measure (payer at delivery).",
      "concerns": "In the public-use Natality file, mother's age is typically measured in integer years, not exact days-from-birthday—so this is not a truly sharp birthday RDD; it's effectively a discrete/fuzzy RD with substantial treatment misclassification.",
      "novelty": "MODERATELY NOVEL"

      "score": 44,
      "verdict": "CONSIDER",
      "strengths": "The policy date is clear and national, and teen birth outcomes are measurable at high frequency with CDC data.",
      "concerns": "RD-in-time is fragile here: teen birth rates were already on a strong secular downward trend.",
