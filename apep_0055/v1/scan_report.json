In the provided code, the main estimation uses rdrobust with its default robust bias-corrected SEs, plus a simple age-25-vs-26 t-test; there is no implementation of KR(2018) discrete-running-variable inference (e.g., via appropriate variance adjustments or dedicated routines). This is not necessarily invalid, but it is a mismatch between claimed and executed inference.: First, I implement the variance estimator of \\citet{kolesar2018} designed for RD with discrete running variables.",

      "evidence": "The paper emphasizes local-polynomial RD with optimal bandwidth selection and robust bias correction. The code calls rdrobust (which can select bandwidths internally), but it also pre-restricts the sample to ages 22\u201330 (\u00b14 years). This does not fully negate rdrobust\u2019s internal bandwidth choice, but it can constrain it (e.g., if the MSE-optimal bandwidth would be wider than 4 years, it cannot be selected). This is a mild implementation divergence from a fully unconstrained optimal-bandwidth approach.: bandwidth <- 4  # Ages 22-30\ndf <- natality[MAGER >= (26 - bandwidth) & MAGER <= (26 + bandwidth)]\n...\nrd_medicaid <- rdrobust(y = df$medicaid, x = df$age_centered, c = 0)",

This is consistent with the manuscript, but it limits transparency for bandwidth sensitivity beyond \u00b14 years and makes it easier to inadvertently lock in a favorable window without later visibility. Not evidence of p-hacking on its own, but worth flagging as a design choice that should be explicitly justified (and ideally parameterized) for replication.: # Basic cleaning\n# Filter to ages 22-30 (gives us bandwidth flexibility around 26)\ndt <- dt[mager >= 22 & mager <= 30]",
