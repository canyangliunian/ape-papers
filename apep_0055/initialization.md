## Topics to Avoid (Already in APEP)

Checked APEP database - 51 papers already published. Key topics to avoid include:
- Social Security eligibility RDDs (age 62, age 65)
- Medicare eligibility RDD
- State minimum wage DiD
- Recreational marijuana age 21 RDD
- Various state mandate DiDs (paid sick leave, insulin caps, auto-IRA, etc.)

No existing papers on birth control/contraception policy - this is a novel direction.
