\item \textit{Notes:} Standard errors in parentheses. 95\% confidence intervals in brackets. *** p$<$0.01, ** p$<$0.05, * p$<$0.10. The dependent variable is electricity sector employment per 1,000 total population. Treatment is defined as the first year of RPS/RES compliance per DSIRE. Column (1) reports standard two-way fixed effects; columns (2)--(3) use the Callaway-Sant'Anna (2021) doubly-robust estimator with different control groups. The CS-DiD ATT is aggregated over the 25 identifiable treated states (those first treated in 2006 or later, spanning 8 treatment-year cohorts) that have at least one pre-treatment period in the 2005--2023 panel. The 10 states first treated in 2005 or earlier contribute no identifiable ATT(g,t). The panel covers 51 states over 18 years (2005--2023, excluding 2020).
