## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-5

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0125
**Parent Title:** Does Local Climate Policy Build Demand for National Action? Evidence from Swiss Energy Referendums
**Parent Decision:** MAJOR REVISION (GPT), MINOR REVISION (Gemini)
**Revision Rationale:** User requested to move non-central exhibits (maps and diagnostic figures) to appendix for cleaner narrative flow

## Key Changes Planned

1. Move Maps 3-4 (Timing, Vote Shares) from main text to appendix
2. Move diagnostic figures (McCrary, Balance, Bandwidth Sensitivity, Donut RDD, RI) to appendix
3. Move CS Event Study to appendix (supplements main event study)
4. Add cross-references from main text to appendix figures
5. Renumber remaining main-text figures sequentially

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **GPT Review:** "Include a clear 'Main results table' in the main text" → consolidate key exhibits, move diagnostics to appendix
2. **GPT Review:** "Some figures have labels that are hard to read" → not addressed in this revision (structural only)
3. **Gemini Review:** Paper already well-organized, minor polish needed → streamline figure placement

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Does sub-national climate policy experience affect support for national climate action?
- Identification strategy: Spatial RDD at Swiss canton borders, same-language specification primary
- Primary data source: swissdd R package (Swiss referendum results)
- Core findings: Negative policy feedback (-5.9 pp, p=0.01 on same-language borders)
