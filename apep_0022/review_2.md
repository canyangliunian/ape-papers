## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excluding references/appendix): FAIL**  
   - The PDF appears to be **~27 pages total**, but **main text ends around p. 22** (“6 Conclusion”), with **References starting ~p. 23** and **Appendix starting ~p. 26**.  
   - That implies **~22 pages of main text**, which is **below the 25-page minimum** (excluding references/appendix).

2. **References (≥15 citations): PASS**  
   - Bibliography contains **~19 references** (e.g., Coile & Gruber; Engelhardt & Gruber; French; Holt-Lunstad et al.; Kolesár & Rothe; Mastrobuoni; McGarry & Schoeni; Murthy; etc.).

3. **Prose Quality (complete paragraphs, no bullet-point sections): PASS**  
   - Introduction, related literature, results, and discussion are written in paragraph form.

4. **Section Completeness (≥3–4 substantive paragraphs each major section): PASS**  
   - Introduction, Background/Literature, Data/Empirical Strategy, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion each have multiple substantive paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all contain visible data and are not broken): PASS**  
   - Figures shown (first stage, living alone, summary panels) display plotted data with axes and fitted lines/bars.

6. **Tables (all contain real numbers, no placeholders): PASS**  
   - Tables include numeric estimates, SEs, p-values, and N; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders observed.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
- **Main-text length is too short**: expand the paper to **≥25 pages excluding references and appendix**.  
  *Practical ways to add substantive length (not padding):* deeper RDD inference discussion for discrete running variables; more robustness (alternative polynomial orders, donut RDD, bin-aggregation approaches, randomization inference); richer mechanism/secondary outcomes; additional heterogeneity; more thorough discussion of external validity and limitations; clearer institutional detail on claiming/eligibility vs take-up.

Per your instructions, I will **not proceed to Phase 2 (content review)** until the Phase 1 length requirement is satisfied.
