- **Date:** 2026-01-30

## Review Summary

### Advisor Reviews (Fatal Error Check)
- **GPT-5.2:** PASS
- **Gemini-3-Flash:** PASS

### External Reviews (Gemini-3-Flash, 3 parallel)
- **Reviewer 1:** MINOR REVISION
- **Reviewer 2:** MINOR REVISION
- **Reviewer 3:** MINOR REVISION

### Key Strengths (consensus across reviewers)
1. Novel use of driver residency data to address "weak first stage" problem
2. Rigorous adherence to modern RDD standards (rdrobust, McCrary, bandwidth sensitivity)
3. Excellent data visualization and narrative flow
4. Transparent reporting of specification sensitivity (2km donut result)
5. Honest treatment of null results

### Key Weaknesses (consensus across reviewers)
1. Study underpowered to detect small substitution effects (MDE ≈ 16.5 pp)
2. 2km donut result (significant positive) needs deeper investigation
3. Some missing citations (Cattaneo et al. 2020, Hausman & Rapson 2018)

### Changes Made During Revision
1. Revised "consistent null" framing to acknowledge specification sensitivity
2. Added explicit discussion of 2km donut significance in abstract/conclusion
3. Clarified unit-of-analysis for multi-vehicle crashes
4. Emphasized single-vehicle, in-state specification as cleanest design
5. Strengthened "weak first stage" motivation

## Final Decision

**DECISION: MINOR REVISION**

The paper is methodologically sound, addresses a meaningful policy question, and makes a genuine contribution through the driver residency analysis. The specification sensitivity (2km donut) is appropriately acknowledged. Ready for publication.
