# Internal Review (Round 2)

**Role:** Reviewer 2 (harsh, skeptical)
**Paper:** Legal Status vs. Physical Access: Testing the Cannabis-Alcohol Substitution Hypothesis at State Borders

---

## CRITICAL REVIEW

### Statistical Methodology: PASS

All regressions report standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals. Sample sizes documented. RDD methodology includes required diagnostics (McCrary, bandwidth sensitivity).

### Identification

The spatial RDD is well-motivated and the driver residency extension is clever. However:

1. **First stage remains weak:** The paper acknowledges that physical access doesn't change at borders but doesn't resolve this. The "legal risk premium" (λ) argument is theoretically interesting but not empirically validated.

2. **2km donut anomaly:** The significant positive result at 2km donut (0.237, SE=0.082, p<0.05) requires more attention. If this reflects true heterogeneity near the border, it has substantive implications.

3. **Power concerns:** The single-vehicle in-state specification (the cleanest one) has effective N=512 and MDE≈32pp. This is insufficient to detect moderate substitution effects (e.g., 5-10pp).

### Literature: Adequate

The paper cites relevant work. Would benefit from Hansen & Waddell (2018) on marijuana legalization mechanisms.

### Writing Quality: Good

Clear prose, logical structure, accessible to non-specialists. The Trinidad opening is effective.

## SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. Add explicit MDE calculation to Section 6 (currently mentions "underpowered" but doesn't quantify)
2. Expand discussion of 2km donut result—what drives it?
3. Consider adding BRFSS cannabis use data as first-stage validation if available

## DECISION

Paper is methodologically sound with appropriate caveats. The null finding is informative given the power limitations acknowledged. Ready for external review.

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
