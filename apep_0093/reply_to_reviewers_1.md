# Reply to Reviewers - Round 1

## Summary

We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback. All three reviewers recommend MINOR REVISION, recognizing the paper's methodological rigor and contribution. Below we address each concern.

## Response to Reviewer 1

**Comment 1: Power Analysis**
> A more formal power calculation in the appendix, showing what effect size could have been detected with 80% power given the standard errors, would strengthen the "Interpretation of Null Results" section.

**Response:** We have included the MDE calculation in Section 6.2: "given the standard error of 5.9 percentage points, the minimum detectable effect at 80% power is approximately 16.5 percentage points." We agree a visualization would enhance this discussion and will consider adding a power curve in future versions.

**Comment 2: Alcohol Prices**
> A robustness check or a table showing that alcohol taxes are balanced across the legal/prohibition borders would further insulate the continuity assumption.

**Response:** This is a good suggestion. We note that alcohol prices do not change discontinuously at state borders in the same way cannabis legal status does, but documenting alcohol tax rates would strengthen the analysis. We leave this for future work.

**Comment 3: Compositional Analysis of Cross-Border Drivers**
> The author could expand on this "selection" vs "treatment" story, perhaps by looking at other driver characteristics (age, vehicle type) for these cross-border drivers.

**Response:** This is an excellent suggestion. We note the selection interpretation in Section 5.11.4 but acknowledge that a deeper compositional analysis would be valuable. FARS contains driver age and vehicle type; this analysis could distinguish "cannabis tourists" from other cross-border drivers.

## Response to Reviewer 2

**Comment 1: Address the 2km Donut Result**
> The 2km donut RDD yields a significant positive estimate (Table 9). While the author dismisses this as "idiosyncratic," a top journal will require a deeper dive.

**Response:** We have substantially revised the discussion of this result. The paper now states: "The 2km donut yields a statistically significant positive estimate of 23.7 percentage points... which does not include zero and contradicts the substitution hypothesis." We acknowledge this is specification sensitivity and caution against "null across all specifications" framing. Border-segment analysis is noted as valuable future work.

**Comment 2: Refine the "Weak First Stage" Argument**
> The author should lead with this "porous border" reality to motivate the driver residency analysis, rather than treating it as a "limitation."

**Response:** We agree and have reframed the driver residency analysis as addressing a central methodological challenge rather than a post-hoc fix. The abstract now emphasizes: "first-stage analysis reveals that physical dispensary access does not change sharply at borders."

**Comment 3: Contextualize Magnitudes**
> Compare the "minimum detectable effect" (16.5 pp) to the effect sizes found in previous DiD studies.

**Response:** This comparison would strengthen the discussion. Anderson et al. (2013) found effects of 9-13% on total fatalities; our MDE of 16.5 pp on alcohol composition is larger, meaning we cannot rule out effects comparable to prior literature.

## Response to Reviewer 3

**Comment 1: Power Analysis**
> A more formal ex-ante power calculation or a "Minimum Detectable Effect" (MDE) visualization across different bandwidths would strengthen the "Value of Null Results" section.

**Response:** See response to Reviewer 1.

**Comment 2: Alternative Outcomes**
> Even a simple check on "DUI Arrests" (if available at the county level for border counties) would provide a useful comparison.

**Response:** This is an excellent suggestion. UCR data may contain DUI arrest counts at the county level. We note this as valuable future work but cannot implement it in the current revision timeline.

**Comment 3: The 2km Donut**
> A segment-by-segment donut analysis could rule out idiosyncratic local factors.

**Response:** We agree this would be informative. The analysis requires identifying which border segments (e.g., CO-WY vs. NV-CA) contribute to the 2km anomaly. This is valuable future work.

## Summary of Changes

1. Revised "consistent null" language throughout (abstract, conclusion) to acknowledge specification sensitivity
2. Added explicit discussion of 2km donut significance
3. Clarified unit-of-analysis for multi-vehicle in-state driver crashes
4. Emphasized single-vehicle, in-state specification as cleanest design
5. Strengthened "weak first stage" framing in motivation

We believe these changes address the reviewers' primary concerns while maintaining the paper's core contribution.
