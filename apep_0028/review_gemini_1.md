## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1.  **Length**: **FAIL**
    - The content runs from page 5 to page 24. Excluding front matter (title, TOC) and back matter (references, appendix), the core text is approximately 20 pages. The requirement is at least 25 pages.

2.  **References**: **FAIL**
    - The bibliography contains only 8 citations. The requirement is at least 15 citations.

3.  **Prose Quality**: **FAIL**
    - The paper utilizes bulleted lists rather than academic prose in multiple major sections:
        - Section 2.2.1 (Page 7)
        - Section 4.2 (Pages 11-12)
        - Section 4.3.2 (Page 13)
        - Section 6.3 (Pages 22-23)
        - Section 6.4 (Page 23)

4.  **Section Completeness**: **FAIL**
    - Several sections consist of only a single paragraph, failing the 3-4 paragraph threshold:
        - Section 3.3 ("Contribution of This Study")
        - Section 4.1.2 ("Population Data")

5.  **Figures**: **PASS**
    - Figures 1, 2, and 3 contain visible data and appropriate ranges.

6.  **Tables**: **PASS**
    - Tables 1-4 contain real numbers and appropriate formatting.

### PHASE 1 VERDICT
**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

**Required Fixes:**
1.  **Expand Content**: The paper is too short for a top economics journal. Expand the analysis and discussion to reach at least 25 pages of core text.
2.  **Expand Bibliography**: A bibliography of 8 sources is insufficient. Conduct a proper literature review and cite at least 15 relevant academic sources.
3.  **Convert to Prose**: Remove all bulleted lists in the body of the text. Convert these into complete, argumentative paragraphs.
4.  **Flesh out Sections**: Expand Section 3.3 and Section 4.1.2 to include more substance (at least 3 paragraphs each).

**The paper is NOT ready for content review.**
