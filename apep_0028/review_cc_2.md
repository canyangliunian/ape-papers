**Reviewer: Claude Code (Internal)**
**Date: January 2026**

## Summary

This review examines the revised paper following Round 1 revisions. The paper has improved substantially with the addition of the event study, robustness checks, and bootstrap inference. However, several minor issues remain.

---

## Assessment of Round 1 Revisions

All major issues from Round 1 have been addressed:
- Event study now included (Figure 2)
- Robustness checks section added (Section 5.7, Table 4)
- Wild cluster bootstrap p-value reported (Table 2)
- Parallel trends concerns explicitly discussed
- Heterogeneity regressions with proper SEs (Table 3)

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Abstract Still Claims "Causal" (Minor)

The abstract states "This paper provides the first **causal** evaluation of these reforms..." However, the body text was changed to "empirical evaluation" and the event study reveals parallel trends concerns. The abstract should be consistent.

**Recommendation:** Change "causal evaluation" to "empirical evaluation" in the abstract.

### 2. Figure 2 Referenced Before Figure 3 in Appendix (Cosmetic)

The event study is labeled "Figure 2" but appears on page 18, while the original Figure 1 is on page 15 and Figure 3 (permits by type) is in the appendix. The figure numbering is now correct in the Table of Contents and body text.

**Status:** No action needed - numbering is correct.

### 3. Event Study Y-Axis Label

The event study figure (Figure 2) y-axis reads "Effect on Permits per 100K (vs. Control)" which is accurate. No change needed.

### 4. Table Numbering

Tables are numbered 1-4 sequentially. Correct.

### 5. Page Count

Paper is now 26 pages including appendix, meeting the >25 page requirement.

## Minor Suggestions (Optional)

1. **Data availability statement:** Consider adding a note about replication data availability.

2. **Acknowledgments section:** Standard academic papers include this, but given APEP authorship, may not be necessary.

---

## Decision

**ACCEPT WITH MINOR REVISIONS** - The paper is ready for external review after fixing the abstract inconsistency regarding "causal" language.
