## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix): FAIL**  
   - Approximate pagination shown: main text runs to about p. 23 (“Conclusion” on p. 23), **References begin on p. 24**, Appendix begins on p. 26.  
   - That implies **~23 pages of main text**, which is **below** the 25-page minimum (excluding references/appendix).

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography): FAIL**  
   - Bibliography lists **8** items ([1]–[8]), which is below the 15-citation requirement.

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): PASS**  
   - The **Introduction, Literature Review, Results, and Discussion** sections are written in paragraph form (bullets appear in the Policy Background, but that is not among the sections you specified to check).

4. **Section Completeness (≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs per major section): PASS (borderline in Literature)**  
   - **Introduction**: clearly ≥ 3–4 paragraphs.  
   - **Literature**: appears to have ~3 substantive paragraphs across subsections (meets the low end, but feels thin).  
   - **Data/Methods, Results, Conclusion**: each appears to have ≥ 3 paragraphs and/or multiple substantive subsections.

5. **Figures (all contain visible data; not empty/broken): PASS**  
   - Figure 1 (time series), Figure 2 (event study), Figure 3 (permit types) all show plotted series/points with axes and visible data.

6. **Tables (real numbers, no placeholders): PASS**  
   - Tables 1–4 contain numeric values; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders observed.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before Phase 2
1. **Increase main-text length** to **≥ 25 pages excluding references and appendix** (currently ~23 pages of main text based on shown pagination).
2. **Expand the bibliography to ≥ 15 citations** (currently 8).  
   - This likely also requires expanding/strengthening the literature review and positioning.

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2 (content review)** until these format issues are addressed.
