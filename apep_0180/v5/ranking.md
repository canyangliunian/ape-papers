### Rankings

**#1: The MVPF of Unconditional Cash Transfers in a Developing Country: Evidence from Kenya's GiveDirectly Program**
- **Score: 76/100**
- **Strengths:** Identification is gold-standard (large RCT with credible spillover estimates), and the replication data are public—very high feasibility. Extending the MVPF framework to a low-income setting with measured general-equilibrium effects is a genuinely useful contribution for development budgeting.
- **Concerns:** The MVPF hinges on fiscal externalities (VAT pass-through, informality, marginal value of public funds, financing assumptions) that are hard to pin down in rural Kenya; results may be sensitive to tax incidence and persistence assumptions. Using the estimated “multiplier” to scale WTP needs careful conceptual justification to avoid double-counting welfare gains vs. transfers.
- **Novelty Assessment:** **Moderate-high.** GiveDirectly and UCTs are extensively studied (including the exact RCTs cited), but an MVPF implementation for a developing-country UCT—especially incorporating experimentally-estimated spillovers—appears meaningfully less covered than standard impact/cost-effectiveness work.
- **Recommendation:** **PURSUE (conditional on: transparent financing/tax-incidence assumptions; sensitivity analysis on persistence and GE/WTP mapping; clear separation of private vs. social surplus to avoid double counting).**

**#2: The MVPF of Nurse-Family Partnership in the United States**
- **Score: 64/100**
- **Strengths:** Identification is strong (multiple RCTs with long-run follow-up), and the policy is highly salient for state/federal human-capital budgets. Rich downstream outcomes (earnings, crime, health) make it well-suited to an MVPF-style accounting.
- **Concerns:** This space is already crowded with benefit-cost analyses (e.g., WSIPP-style accounting, RAND, numerous economics papers), so an MVPF may be viewed as reframing rather than discovery unless it changes key conclusions. Microdata access is uncertain, and relying on published subgroup estimates may force strong assumptions (especially for WTP vs. government savings and for extrapolating lifetime impacts).
- **Novelty Assessment:** **Low-moderate.** NFP itself is very heavily studied; “NFP not yet in the MVPF library” is not the same as being novel in the broader literature. The novelty would come only from a careful MVPF translation that resolves ambiguities in valuation and financing.
- **Recommendation:** **CONSIDER (conditional on: demonstrating what MVPF adds beyond existing cost-benefit work; pre-specifying valuation choices for non-market outcomes; assembling consistent lifetime fiscal/benefit streams across trials).**

**#3: The MVPF of Denmark's "Start Aid" Refugee Integration Policy**
- **Score: 56/100**
- **Strengths:** A policy discontinuity at implementation date can be a clean design, and Danish registers allow unusually complete long-run fiscal accounting (including children). Policy relevance is high given ongoing debates on refugee benefit generosity and integration incentives.
- **Concerns:** “RD at a date” is only as good as the inability to manipulate timing—residency/municipal processing, anticipation, or compositional changes around July 2002 could threaten continuity; you’d need strong balance/bunching and institutional evidence. Data feasibility is a major bottleneck (register access), and the policy coincides with other integration-related reforms in many European contexts—requiring careful audit of concurrent changes and cohort composition.
- **Novelty Assessment:** **Moderate.** The Start Aid reform and its labor-market/child effects have a known literature; the incremental novelty is packaging into MVPF with intergenerational fiscal externalities, which is useful but not “new policy/new evidence.”
- **Recommendation:** **CONSIDER (conditional on: secured register access; strong no-manipulation/continuity diagnostics; explicit accounting for any coincident reforms and compositional shifts).**

**#4: The MVPF of Finland's Universal Basic Income Experiment**
- **Score: 46/100**
- **Strengths:** Random assignment is excellent, and Finland’s administrative infrastructure is ideal in principle for credible fiscal accounting. The policy is globally visible, so an MVPF could be communicatively powerful.
- **Concerns:** Data access is a serious practical barrier (Statistics Finland permissions/institutional requirements), and the experiment is small (2,000 treated) with modest/imprecise labor-supply impacts—so fiscal externality estimates will be noisy and MVPF conclusions fragile. Also, the “UBI experiment” has already generated substantial analysis and commentary, limiting novelty unless you obtain microdata and add something materially new.
- **Novelty Assessment:** **Low-moderate.** “First MVPF” is novel as a label, but the Finnish UBI experiment itself is widely studied and summarized; without register microdata, this risks becoming a thin repackaging of published ITT tables.
- **Recommendation:** **SKIP (unless you can secure microdata access and a clear value-add beyond existing summaries—e.g., tighter fiscal incidence and heterogeneity).**

### Summary

This is a solid batch in terms of **identification** (all rely on experimental or quasi-experimental variation), but two proposals are severely constrained by **data access** (Finland, Denmark). The clear “first to do now” project is **Kenya GiveDirectly MVPF** because it combines strong identification with public data and a plausible novelty angle (MVPF in a low-income setting with measured spillovers). **NFP** is feasible and policy-relevant but must overcome the “already heavily cost-benefit analyzed” critique by showing what MVPF changes conceptually or quantitatively.
