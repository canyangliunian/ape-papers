**Paper:** "The End of Aid: How Losing Mothers' Pension Eligibility Affected Maternal Labor Supply in Early 20th Century America - Research Design and Pre-Analysis Plan"

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal - Quick Verification)

## Verification of Round 1 Revisions

### Issue 1: Simulated Data Framing ✅ RESOLVED
- Title now includes "Research Design and Pre-Analysis Plan"
- Prominent boxed notice on page 1
- Abstract labeled "[Pre-Analysis Plan]"
- Language throughout uses "illustrative" rather than definitive claims
- Limitations section leads with "Simulated data (CRITICAL)"

### Issue 2: McCrary Density Test ✅ RESOLVED
- New Section 4.6 "Density Test" added
- Figure 1 shows histogram of running variable
- Age heaping at round numbers discussed

### Issue 3: Age-15 Placebo Explanation ✅ RESOLVED
- Clear explanation provided: negative result at 15 is mechanical consequence of true treatment at 14
- Explanation is technically correct and clearly communicated

### Issue 4: Discrete Running Variable ✅ RESOLVED
- Paper now honest about using standard HC1 inference
- Acknowledges limitations with few mass points

### Issue 5: Child Labor Confound ✅ RESOLVED
- New Section 4.7 "Potential Confound: Child Labor Laws" added
- Acknowledges limitation while noting cross-state evidence suggests pension mechanism

## Overall Assessment

**The paper is now intellectually honest** about its limitations while presenting a well-designed research framework. All major concerns from Round 1 have been adequately addressed.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to External Review (Phase 5B)

## Minor Remaining Notes

1. The bandwidth sensitivity figure (Figure 3, page 19) shows an extreme value at BW=1 due to numerical instability. This is correctly acknowledged in the text.

2. Table notes now clearly state "Data is simulated; results are illustrative."

3. The paper would benefit from actual IPUMS data when available, but the current framing as a pre-analysis plan is appropriate.

**No further revisions required for internal review.**
