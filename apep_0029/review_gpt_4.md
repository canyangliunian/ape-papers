## Summary (what the paper is trying to do)
This paper studies how *losing* eligibility for early 20th-century U.S. mothers’ pensions affected widowed mothers’ labor supply. The core idea is a sharp age-based termination rule (typically when the youngest child turns 14) and a regression discontinuity design (RDD) using Census microdata, with cross-state variation in cutoffs used as validation/placebos.

As written, however, the manuscript is explicitly a **pre-analysis plan with simulated data**, and therefore it is **not an admissible contribution for AER/QJE/Ecta** in its current form. A top journal could consider a short design paper *only if* the design solves a major identification problem *and* is empirically executed; here the “results” are mechanically generated by the simulation. Below I evaluate both (i) whether the eventual empirical design could be publishable and (ii) whether the current draft meets top-journal standards.

# 1. FORMAT CHECK

### Length
- The PDF appears to be **~34 pages including references and appendix** (pages shown up to 34).
- Main text appears to run to **~30 pages** (Section 8 ends around p. 30), which **passes** the 25-page bar.

### References
- The bibliography covers core RDD references (Lee & Lemieux; Calonico et al.; McCrary; Kolesár & Rothe; Lee & Card) and some relevant policy/welfare references.
- **But** it is **not yet adequate** for a top journal on (i) RD foundations, (ii) discrete-running-variable practice, and (iii) the mothers’ pensions / early welfare state economic history literature (details and BibTeX below).

### Prose / structure
- Major sections are written in paragraphs, not bullets. **Pass.**
- The paper reads like a pre-analysis plan but is formatted like a standard paper; for a top journal, you must decide which it is. Right now it is neither a clean PAP nor a finished empirical article.

### Section depth
- Introduction, background, strategy, discussion are multi-paragraph. **Pass at the macro level.**
- Several key *identification-threat* subsections (e.g., selection/co-residence, discrete running variable inference) are **flagged but not executed**; for a top journal, these need to be developed into full empirical sections.

### Figures
- Figures shown have visible data, axes, and cutoffs. **Pass**, conditional on final versions being publication quality (resolution, fonts, consistent styles).
- However, some figures are based on simulated data; that’s fine for a PAP, but not for an AER/QJE/Ecta submission.

### Tables
- Tables contain numeric entries with SEs in several cases. **Pass** mechanically.
- Some tables omit sample sizes (e.g., placebo table) and some contain “—” placeholders (Table 7). Also Table 1 is **incomplete/vague** (“17+ Various states”) for a paper whose core identification depends on cutoff rules.

---

# 2. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY (CRITICAL)

### (a) Standard errors
- Many key estimates report SEs in parentheses (e.g., Table 3). **Pass.**
- But not *every* table cell is fully specified with inference and/or N (see below). A top journal will insist on complete reporting.

### (b) Significance testing
- Significance stars and/or p-values are reported in key places. **Pass.**

### (c) Confidence intervals
- Table 3 includes 95% CIs. **Pass.**
- Other results (placebos, donut, cross-state) should also report CIs for consistency.

### (d) Sample sizes
- Table 3 reports N; summary stats do too.
- Several other tables (placebos, covariate balance, donut, cross-state) should also report **N** and ideally **effective N** within bandwidth. Right now, reporting is incomplete.

### (e) DiD with staggered adoption
- Not applicable; the design is RD, not DiD. **Pass-by-irrelevance.**

### (f) RDD requirements: bandwidth sensitivity + McCrary
- Bandwidth sensitivity is provided (Figure 3, Table 3). **Pass** in spirit.
- Manipulation/density testing is discussed (Section 4.7) and a p-value is reported. **Partial pass**, but:
  - You need to implement and report a standard manipulation test in the final empirical version (e.g., **Cattaneo-Jansson-Ma** density test or McCrary with modern corrections), with specification choices transparent and robustness shown.

## The real problem: inference is not yet credible for the *actual setting*
Even if all the reporting boxes are ticked, **inference is not yet acceptable for a discrete running variable** in a top-journal RD application.

Concretely:
1. You acknowledge discreteness (Section 4.5) but the “results” are conventional heteroskedastic-robust SEs on simulated data. For the real paper you must implement:
   - **Design-based / local randomization inference** (Cattaneo et al. 2015 framework) or
   - **Kolesár–Rothe honest inference** *and show it*, not just promise it.
2. With few mass points (ages in years), conventional asymptotics can materially understate uncertainty. Age-level clustering is mentioned but not actually used/reported.
3. Pooling across states introduces additional dependence (state labor markets, enumerator practices, age heaping). You will almost certainly need clustering at least at **state × youngest-child-age** or a randomization-inference approach.

### Bottom line on methodology
- The *planned* methodology could be publishable, but **the current manuscript is not**, because the “results” are mechanically simulated and the discrete-RD inference is not executed. As a top-journal submission, this is **unpublishable as-is**.

# 3. IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY

### Core RD validity
The conceptual RD is appealing: benefits end when the youngest child crosses a statutory age threshold, and that threshold differs across states. This is a strong starting point.

But several threats are under-addressed:

1. **Eligibility vs. receipt (sharp vs. fuzzy RD)**
   - You treat it as “sharp in eligibility” with ITT interpretation. That is fine, but the real world likely has:
     - administrative delays,
     - discretionary extensions (disability, schooling, moral fitness),
     - county-level implementation differences,
     - incomplete take-up.
   - This means the design is plausibly **fuzzy in practice** even if sharp in statute. You need to show what “termination at 14” means administratively and whether termination is immediate or at review dates.

2. **Running variable measurement error and heaping**
   - Age misreporting/heaping in historical censuses is nontrivial. A density test alone is not sufficient; you must show:
     - robustness to heaping corrections (e.g., dropping heaped ages like 14/15, or modeling misclassification),
     - “donut” choices justified (how wide; why exclude 13–14 specifically),
     - whether enumerator/date-of-enumeration issues create systematic rounding.

3. **Sample selection from co-residence**
   - You correctly flag co-residence selection (Section 4.9), but it is potentially first-order:
     - If pension loss causes the child to leave home (or to be placed with relatives), the “youngest co-resident child” jumps endogenously.
     - Then the RD estimand is not “income shock → mom works” but “income shock → household reorganization + sample composition change.”
   - In the final paper this cannot remain a footnote; it must be an entire empirical section with:
     - RD estimates for the probability of co-residence / being observed as widowed head,
     - RD estimates for household size, number of own children present, presence of boarders/relatives,
     - bounding/sensitivity analysis if selection is detected.

4. **Confounding policies at age 14 (child labor / compulsory schooling)**
   - You mention child labor laws (Section 4.8), but the current mitigation (cross-state cutoff variation) is not sufficient on its own because:
     - compulsory schooling and work-permit ages also vary across states and time,
     - enforcement varies by county/urbanization,
     - “age 14” is a social/legal threshold beyond pensions (school exit, work permits, apprenticeship).
   - A more credible approach is a **difference-in-discontinuities** design:
     - compare the discontinuity at age 14 in cutoff-14 states to the discontinuity at age 14 in cutoff-16 states (and similarly for age 16).
     - This directly nets out “generic age-14 discontinuities” unrelated to pensions.

5. **Sorting across states / migration**
   - If mothers relocate to states/counties with different generosity/cutoffs (even imperfectly), identification is threatened. Likely small, but you need to test for discontinuities in migration proxies (birth state vs. residence; years in state if available; nativity).

### Do conclusions follow?
- The paper’s “findings” do not follow from evidence because the evidence is simulated by construction. The design discussion is plausible; the conclusions about magnitude are not.

### Limitations
- Limitations are discussed (Section 7.4). **Good**, but these need to become empirical diagnostics in the final version, not only narrative caveats.

# 4. LITERATURE (missing references + BibTeX)

## Missing / underused methodology references
You cite many modern RD papers, but a top journal will expect explicit engagement with:

1. **Foundational identification result for RD**
```bibtex
@article{HahnToddVanderKlaauw2001,
  author  = {Hahn, Jinyong and Todd, Petra and van der Klaauw, Wilbert},
  title   = {Identification and Estimation of Treatment Effects with a Regression-Discontinuity Design},
  journal = {Econometrica},
  year    = {2001},
  volume  = {69},
  number  = {1},
  pages   = {201--209}
}
```
Why: canonical RD identification; strengthens theoretical grounding beyond guides/surveys.

2. **Optimal bandwidth choice (IK is not just Imbens & Lemieux 2008)**
```bibtex
@article{ImbensKalyanaraman2012,
  author  = {Imbens, Guido and Kalyanaraman, Karthik},
  title   = {Optimal Bandwidth Choice for the Regression Discontinuity Estimator},
  journal = {Review of Economic Studies},
  year    = {2012},
  volume  = {79},
  number  = {3},
  pages   = {933--959}
}
```
Why: you mention IK but do not cite it; also important for credibility in bandwidth selection.

3. **rdrobust software citation (if you will use it)**
(Exact publication details vary by outlet/version; one commonly cited reference is:)
```bibtex
@article{CalonicoCattaneoTitiunik2015,
  author  = {Calonico, Sebastian and Cattaneo, Matias D. and Titiunik, Rocio},
  title   = {rdrobust: An {R} Package for Robust Nonparametric Inference in Regression-Discontinuity Designs},
  journal = {The R Journal},
  year    = {2015},
  volume  = {7},
  number  = {1},
  pages   = {38--51}
}
```
Why: top journals want software/reproducibility citations when methods rely on them.

## Missing domain/economic history references (examples)
Your policy background leans heavily on a few secondary sources plus Aizer et al. (2016) and Thompson (2019). For an AER/QJE/Ecta-style contribution you need broader positioning in early U.S. social policy and women’s labor supply history. At minimum, consider engaging with:

- Economic history of social welfare administration and local discretion (county implementation mattered enormously for mothers’ pensions).
- Women’s labor supply measurement in early censuses (gainful occupation vs. labor force status).
- Interactions with compulsory schooling and child labor enforcement.

If you want specific citations, I recommend adding at least one or two core quantitative economic history references on early welfare state implementation and measurement. (I am not supplying BibTeX for these without being sure of exact bibliographic metadata; you should add them with precise details.)

# 5. WRITING AND PRESENTATION

### Clarity and structure
- The paper is clearly written, and the RD intuition is accessible.
- However, it oscillates between “paper” and “pre-analysis plan.” For a top journal:
  - either submit as a true PAP (shorter, registry-linked, no “results” section framed as results), or
  - submit as a full paper (real data, final inference).

### Presentation quality
- Figures appear clean with axes and cutoffs.
- Some captions/notes are a bit verbose and repeat the text.
- Table 1 is not acceptable in its current form (incomplete state lists; vague “17+”; and it contradicts the narrative claim that 14 is “most common” while listing only 8 states at cutoff 14).

### Grammar/style issues
- Generally strong.
- Some claims are too definitive given the paper’s own disclaimer (e.g., “strongly suggests” in Results when results are simulated).

---

# 6. CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS (to make it top-journal impactful)

## A. Make the identification airtight
1. **Difference-in-discontinuities / multi-cutoff RD**
   - Implement a design comparing discontinuities at the same age across different cutoff states.
   - Use the **multiple-cutoff RD framework** (you already cite Cattaneo et al. 2016) in a central way, not just as a robustness note.

2. **Directly estimate selection at the cutoff**
   - RD outcomes:
     - indicator that youngest child is an “own child,”
     - number of own children present,
     - probability any child present (for all widows, not only those with children),
     - headship and household composition (boarders/relatives).
   - If selection is present, consider bounding (Lee bounds-style logic adapted to RD selection) or re-define the running variable using “own children ever born” proxies if possible.

3. **Child labor and schooling mechanisms**
   - Add outcomes for children at the cutoff (work status, school attendance where available in 1940; for 1920/1930 you may have limited schooling variables).
   - Bring in state-year compulsory schooling and child labor law parameters and test whether effects align with pension cutoffs rather than schooling/work-permit cutoffs.

## B. Upgrade inference to meet Ecta/AER standards
1. **Discrete running variable inference**
   - Report Kolesár–Rothe honest CIs and/or local randomization inference as *main* inference, not appendix.
2. **Clustering / dependence**
   - At minimum, cluster by **youngest-child-age × state** (or use randomization inference).
3. **Weights**
   - Decide whether to use IPUMS person weights; justify. If full count, weights may be irrelevant, but for 1% samples they matter.

## C. Measurement and sample definition
1. **Labor supply measure**
   - In 1920/1930, “labor force participation” is not measured in the modern sense; often it is “gainful occupation.” Be explicit about:
     - what EMPSTAT/LABFORCE means in those years,
     - whether “seeking work” is observed at all,
     - robustness to alternative coding (occupation reported vs. not; weeks worked if available later).
2. **Population**
   - Restricting to “female household heads” may induce selection correlated with economic need. Consider including *all* widowed mothers (not only heads) and control for household structure, or show headship is smooth at the cutoff.

## D. Move from ITT to something interpretable
- If you can link to administrative pension records (even aggregated county spending/rolls), you could:
  - validate take-up patterns around the cutoff,
  - implement a fuzzy-RD or an IV scaling to approximate TOT with defensible first-stage evidence.

# 7. OVERALL ASSESSMENT

### Key strengths
- The statutory age cutoff is a compelling quasi-experiment.
- Cross-state variation in cutoff ages is an unusually strong opportunity for falsification and multi-cutoff designs.
- The manuscript anticipates several key threats (discrete running variable, selection, child labor laws), which is a good sign.

### Critical weaknesses (fatal for a top journal in current form)
1. **No real data**: results are simulated and therefore not evidence.
2. **Inference not yet executed for the real identification problem**: discrete-running-variable RD requires more than conventional robust SEs.
3. **Selection/co-residence is potentially first-order** and currently not addressed empirically.
4. **Confounds at age thresholds** (schooling/work permits) require a tighter design (difference-in-discontinuities) and richer outcome set (children’s work/schooling).

### What would make it publishable
A publishable version would (i) execute the design on real microdata, (ii) center discrete-RD-appropriate inference, (iii) demonstrate no selection/manipulation, (iv) implement difference-in-discontinuities using states with different cutoffs, and (v) speak directly to mechanisms (child work/schooling vs. mother work).
