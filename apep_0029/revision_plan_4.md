## Summary of External Reviews

**GPT 5.2:** REJECT AND RESUBMIT
- Design is "strong and intuitive source of quasi-experimental variation"
- "Good awareness of methodological issues"
- Remaining concerns: more welfare/labor literature, multi-cutoff RD methods

**Gemini 3 Pro:** REJECT AND RESUBMIT
- "A rigorous, textbook-quality application of Regression Discontinuity Design"
- "Cross-State Validation is a brilliant way to isolate the policy effect"
