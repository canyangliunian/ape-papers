      "evidence": "The manuscript describes an ACS PUMS (IPUMS) analysis of self-employment (incorporated vs unincorporated) using IPW. The code instead repeatedly refers to an object named `cps` loaded from `cps_analysis.rds` and uses `multiple_jobs` as the treatment indicator (a name strongly associated with a different project: multiple job holding). While the script also uses `incorporated`/`unincorporated`, the treatment naming and file naming are inconsistent with the manuscript\u2019s ACS/PUMS framing and with `01_fetch_data.R` (which produces `acs_pums_raw.rds`). This raises a serious risk that the executed analysis is not the one described in paper.tex (or that datasets/variables were repurposed without clear documentation).: cps <- readRDS(file.path(data_dir, \"cps_analysis.rds\"))\n...\n# PART 1: Aggregate Self-Employment Effects by Gender\n...\nresult <- estimate_gender_effect(gender_data)\n...\n# PART 2: Incorporated Effects by Gender\n...\nfilter(multiple_jobs == 0 | incorporated == 1) %>%\nmutate(treatment = incorporated)\n...\n# PART 3: Unincorporated Effects by Gender\n...\nfilter(multiple_jobs == 0 | unincorporated == 1) %>%\nmutate(treatment = unincorporated)",

The provenance of this central analytic dataset is missing: none of the provided code constructs `cps_analysis.rds` from the ACS PUMS data fetched in `01_fetch_data.R`, so the reported gender/state estimates (and downstream atlas figures relying on `state_results.rds`) depend on an undocumented, non-reproducible upstream dataset.",
