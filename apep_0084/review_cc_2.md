## FOLLOW-UP REVIEW AFTER ROUND 1

This is a follow-up review focusing on issues raised in Round 1 and checking for any remaining concerns.

### Issues from Round 1 - Status

1. **Missing literature**: Still needs citations for Cerdá et al., Aydelotte et al., Santaella-Tenorio meta-analysis. PENDING.

2. **Magnitude interpretation**: Could benefit from more context, but the 7.6% relative effect is now adequately discussed.

3. **Heterogeneity analyses**: Weekend effects are not shown but could strengthen paper.

### Remaining Technical Issues

1. **Figure 2 verification**: With the new state labels showing drive times, the figure is now internally consistent.

2. **Dispensary sample construction**: The revised explanation (89-92% matching December 2015 records) is clearer and resolves the earlier contradiction.

3. **Date-accurate NV treatment**: Paper now correctly specifies July 1, 2017 for Nevada availability.

### Minor Issues for Polishing

1. Some awkward phrasing in Discussion section
2. Could add 1-2 more robustness checks to appendix
3. Footnote formatting could be more consistent

### Assessment

The paper has addressed the major methodological concerns from Round 1. The remaining issues are minor and can be addressed in revision.

The paper makes a solid contribution by:
- Introducing a novel geographic identification strategy
- Providing credible evidence on marijuana-alcohol substitution
- Using appropriate inference methods for the clustered structure
