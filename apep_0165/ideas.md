# Research Ideas (Inherited from Parent)

This is a revision of APEP-0146. The research question and design are inherited from the parent paper.

## Idea 1: Effect of Salary Transparency Laws on Wages and Gender Gap

**Policy:** State salary transparency laws requiring employers to disclose salary ranges in job postings (Colorado 2021, Connecticut 2021, Nevada 2021, Rhode Island 2023, California 2023, Washington 2023, New York 2023, Hawaii 2024)

**Outcome:** Hourly wages and gender wage gap from CPS ASEC

**Identification:** Staggered DiD with Callaway-Sant'Anna heterogeneity-robust estimator

**Why it's novel:** First causal estimates of job-posting transparency (vs. weaker "right-to-ask" or internal disclosure)

**Feasibility check:** Confirmed - 8 treated states, 43 control states, 6+ pre-treatment years, ~650,000 observations
