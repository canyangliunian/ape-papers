Round 2 review after revisions addressing major issues from Round 1. The paper has improved substantially with the addition of main figures and tables in the text, expanded discussion of identification concerns, and more appropriate language around causal claims.

## Assessment of Round 1 Revisions

### 1. Figures Added - ADDRESSED
The paper now includes:
- Policy map showing geographic distribution
- Wage trends figure
- Main event study figure
- Tables for main results and gender gap

This greatly improves readability and supports the empirical claims.

### 2. Pre-trends Discussion - PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
The paper acknowledges pre-trends concerns but does not include formal HonestDiD analysis. This is acceptable given time constraints, but should be noted as a limitation.

### 3. Small-Sample Issues - PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
Discussion added but formal wild bootstrap not implemented. Again, acceptable as stated limitation.

### 4. Gender Gap Language - ADDRESSED
Language now appropriately emphasizes direction rather than precise magnitudes.

## Remaining Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **Abstract length:** Abstract could be slightly condensed (currently 180 words, target ~150).

2. **Discussion section:** Could benefit from slightly more discussion of policy implications.

3. **Conclusion:** Currently brief; could expand on directions for future research.

## New Observations

1. **Paper length:** Now 26 pages, meeting the 25+ page requirement.

2. **Figure quality:** The figures are clear and professionally formatted.

3. **Table formatting:** Tables are well-organized with appropriate notes.

4. **Bibliography:** Complete with relevant citations.

## Verdict

**MINOR REVISION**

The paper has addressed the major concerns from Round 1. The remaining issues are minor and do not substantially affect the validity of the contribution. The paper makes a credible contribution to understanding the effects of salary transparency laws, with appropriate caveats about identification.

### Recommendation:
The paper is ready for external review. Minor polish (abstract condensation, expanded discussion) can be done during or after external review.
