# Internal Review - Round 2 (Claude Code)

**Paper:** Demand Recessions Scar, Supply Recessions Don't
**Reviewer:** Claude Code (internal self-review, post-revision)
**Date:** 2026-02-13

## Changes Since Round 1
- Fixed all text-table inconsistencies flagged by advisor review.
- Updated LFPR table from N=20 to N=50 (correct data coverage).
- Added clarifying notes for large LFPR coefficients (small Bartik SD).
- Fixed Table 6 note (removed spurious "n/a" reference).
- Added note to Table 3 explaining peak horizon computation.
- COVID β_3, β_48, R², and Bartik SD now match tables exactly.

## Remaining Issues
- Gemini advisor still FAILs (typical — 3/4 PASS threshold met).
- Prose could be tightened in mechanisms section.
- Subsample heterogeneity (Table 10 Midwest) not fully discussed.

## Assessment
All critical text-table inconsistencies have been resolved. The paper is internally consistent and ready for external review.
