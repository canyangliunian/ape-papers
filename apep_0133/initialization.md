**Parent Title:** Does Local Climate Policy Build Demand for National Action? Evidence from Swiss Energy Referendums
**Parent Decision:** MINOR REVISION

## Key Changes Planned

1. **Fix RDD Figures:** Replace pre-correction "illustrative" RDD figures with corrected sample figures using proper running variable (distance to own canton border)
2. **Remove Event Study:** Remove canton-level event study figure and Callaway-Sant'Anna event study as requested
3. **Fix Table Formatting:** Adjust table formatting to eliminate overfull boxes and improve page fit

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **Figure clarity:** RDD figures now use corrected sample with proper running variable
2. **Event study appropriateness:** Removed as per user request
3. **Table formatting:** Tables now properly fit within page margins

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Does local climate policy build demand for national action?
- Identification strategy: Spatial RDD at Swiss canton borders
- Primary data source: swissdd (Swiss referendum data) and BFS (spatial data)
