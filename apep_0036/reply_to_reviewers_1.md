# Reply to Internal Reviewers - Round 1

## Response to Reviewer 2

### Major Concern 1: Simulated Data

> The paper uses simulated CPS data rather than actual survey data.

**Response:** We have revised the paper to clearly acknowledge the simulated data limitation:

1. Updated title to: "A Methodological Framework with Simulated Evidence"
2. Updated abstract to note this is a methodological demonstration
3. Added explicit caveat in Introduction about simulated data
4. Framed contribution as methodological proof-of-concept

We agree that credible empirical findings require real data. We have structured the paper and code to facilitate replication with actual CPS ASEC data once obtained.

### Major Concern 2: U-Shaped Pattern Interpretation

> The theoretical mechanism is underdeveloped.

**Response:** We acknowledge this is an area for future development. The paper now frames the U-shaped pattern as a hypothesis to be tested with real data rather than a confirmed finding. We note that workers at both extremes may have clearer signals about their labor market position, while middle-automation workers face greater uncertainty.

### Major Concern 3: Fuzzy RD Issues

> The first stage should be shown explicitly.

**Response:** We have added discussion noting that our estimates are intent-to-treat effects and that first-stage estimation would require administrative data on EITC receipt (e.g., IRS tax filing data).

### Minor Concerns

1. **Sample counts:** Confirmed consistent (7,477 + 9,860 = 17,337)
2. **Figure 2:** This remains to be added in a future revision
3. **Robustness patterns:** Added brief discussion of variation across specifications

## Response to Editor

Thank you for the constructive feedback. We have:

1. Added clear caveats about simulated data (Required - Done)
2. Figure 2 to be added (Required - Pending)
3. Added fuzzy RD discussion (Required - Done)
4. Will expand theoretical framework in next revision (Suggested - Pending)

We believe these revisions address the most critical concerns while acknowledging remaining limitations.
