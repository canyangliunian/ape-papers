# Revision Plan - Round 1

## Response to Internal Review

### Major Issue: Simulated Data

**Reviewer concern:** Paper uses simulated data, limiting credibility.

**Response:** We acknowledge this limitation and will:
1. Update title to include "A Methodological Framework"
2. Add clear statement in abstract about simulated data
3. Add section discussing how to implement with real data
4. Frame contribution as methodological + proof-of-concept

### Issue: U-Shaped Pattern Interpretation

**Response:** Will expand theoretical framework to explain why middle-automation workers may not respond:
- Workers at extremes have clearest signals about labor market position
- Middle workers face ambiguity about job security
- EITC may not change behavior when signals are unclear

### Issue: Fuzzy RD

**Response:** Will add discussion of ITT interpretation and note that first-stage (EITC take-up) would need administrative data.

### Issue: Missing Figure 2

**Response:** Will add covariate smoothness figure.

### Issue: Robustness Discussion

**Response:** Will expand discussion of robustness check patterns.

## Changes to Make

1. Update title to: "Does Income Support Help Workers Navigate Automation Risk? A Methodological Framework and Simulated Evidence"

2. Update abstract first sentence to note methodological contribution

3. Add paragraph in Introduction about simulated data

4. Add Figure 2 (covariate smoothness)

5. Expand Section 6 (Mechanisms) with theoretical framework for U-shape

6. Add paragraph on fuzzy RD interpretation in Methods

7. Expand robustness discussion
