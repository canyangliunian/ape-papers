## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The manuscript is numbered through p. 25, but the **References / Data Availability / Acknowledgments** material is included within those pages. The **core paper text (Intro through Conclusion)** appears to end around p. 21–22, implying **< 25 pages of main text**.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
   - The bibliography lists **19** references (items 1–19).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion; complete paragraphs)**: **FAIL**  
   - The paper uses **bullet points** (e.g., in **Section 4 Conceptual Framework**, where heterogeneous predictions are listed as bullets). This violates the “all text in complete paragraphs” requirement.

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has ≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **PASS**  
   - **Introduction**: clearly 3–4+ paragraphs.  
   - **Literature**: multiple substantive paragraphs.  
   - **Data**: multiple subsections with substantive paragraphs.  
   - **Methods/Empirical Strategy**: multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Results**: multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Conclusion**: multiple paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data)**: **PASS**  
   - No figures are included/shown in the provided manuscript text; thus there are **no broken/empty figures to fail** under this rule.

6. **Tables (all tables have real numbers, no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables shown (Tables 1–4) contain numeric values (rates, sample sizes), not placeholders like “TBD/XXX”.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Length**: Expand the **main text** (excluding references/appendix) to **≥ 25 pages**. This typically means adding substantive material (not padding): e.g., clearer institutional detail on SF0018 implementation and exclusions; stronger robustness section; more diagnostics; more interpretation and external validity discussion; additional related literature synthesis.
2. **No bullet points (prose-only requirement)**: Convert bullet lists (notably in **Section 4**) into full paragraph prose. If you need “predictions,” integrate them into narrative text (or move lists to an appendix, if allowed by your target journal—but under your stated rule, bullets trigger a FAIL).

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until these format issues are corrected.
