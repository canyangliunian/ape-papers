## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The main text appears to run through p. 23 (“Conclusion” ends on p. 23), with **References beginning on p. 24** and ancillary sections (“Data Availability,” “Acknowledgments”) on p. 25.  
   - That implies **~23 pages of main text**, which is **below the ≥25-page requirement (excluding references/appendix)**.

2. **References (≥15 citations)**: **PASS**  
   - Bibliography lists **19 references** (numbered 1–19).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet-point sections in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **PASS**  
   - The provided sections are written as continuous prose paragraphs (tables present, but no bullet lists in these core sections).

4. **Section Completeness (≥3–4 substantive paragraphs per major section)**: **PASS**  
   - **Introduction**: clearly ≥4 paragraphs.  
   - **Related Literature**: ≥3 paragraphs.  
   - **Data**: ≥3 paragraphs.  
   - **Empirical Strategy**: ≥3 paragraphs.  
   - **Results**: ≥3 paragraphs.  
   - **Conclusion**: ≥3 paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all figures show visible data; none broken/empty)**: **PASS (No figures to evaluate)**  
   - In the excerpt provided, I do not see any figures—only tables. No broken/empty figures observed.

6. **Tables (no placeholders; real numbers)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables 1–4 contain numerical values (no “TBD/XXX” placeholders).

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
- **Main text length is below the minimum**: Expand the paper to **at least 25 pages of main text** (excluding references/appendix).  
  - Concretely: add ~2+ pages of substantive content (not spacing). Typical ways to do this credibly include (i) deeper institutional detail on SF 0018 implementation and exemptions, (ii) a fuller data/measurement appendix embedded in main text, (iii) additional robustness/alternative specifications, (iv) expanded discussion of inference with one treated unit, or (v) an added section on alternative data (licensing-board administrative data) and an explicit plan for validation.

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until the Phase 1 issue is resolved.
