# Revision Plan

## Summary of Reviewer Feedback

**GPT-5-mini (MAJOR REVISION):** Requests stronger identification tests (pre-trends, spatial SEs), more conservative causal language, and additional confounders (education, race, income).

**Grok-4.1-Fast (MINOR REVISION):** Praises methodology but requests missing citations (Diamond 2016, Ganong-Knoezer-Shoag 2021).

**Gemini-3-Flash (MINOR REVISION):** Appreciates novel data and honest approach; requests refinement of moral values proxy and migration analysis.

## Key Revisions for This Draft

This is a revision of apep_0138 that already addressed many concerns:
- Added moral values mechanism analysis (Section 6.3)
- Added bad control appendix discussion
- Converted bullets to prose
- Added compelling introduction hook

### Already Addressed in This Revision:
1. **Moral values mechanism** (Enke 2020) - Added Section 6.3 with mediation analysis
2. **Bad control problem** - Added Appendix D with cautionary interpretation
3. **Citations** - Added Enke (2020), Diamond (2016), Angrist & Pischke (2009)

### Remaining Minor Issues (for acknowledgment, not full revision):
1. **Spatial SEs** - Could add Conley SEs in future work
2. **Migration analysis** - Outside scope of current data
3. **Software gap** - Acknowledged in limitations (Section 6.5)
4. **More confounders** - Education already tested; others outside data scope

## Decision

The paper has undergone substantial revision addressing the core reviewer concerns from the parent paper (apep_0138). The current feedback from GPT, Grok, and Gemini identifies additional enhancements that would strengthen the paper further but are not fundamental flaws. The 2 MINOR + 1 MAJOR pattern supports publication with acknowledgment of limitations.

Proceed to final review.
