# Reply to Reviewers

## Response to GPT-5-mini

Thank you for your thorough review. We address your main points:

**1. Numerical inconsistency (10-year vs SD effects):** Fixed. We now clearly report 0.75 pp per 10 years (coefficient: 0.075 pp/year) and 1.2 pp per 1 SD (~16 years) throughout the manuscript.

**2. Additional confounders:** We tested moral values proxies (Section 6.3) and found zero attenuation, suggesting technology captures something distinct. Education controls are discussed but limited by data availability at CBSA level.

**3. Spatial SEs:** We acknowledge this suggestion. State-level clustering yields similar inference (noted in Section 5.9.5). Conley SEs would strengthen future work.

**4. Pre-trends:** Our gains analysis (Table 7) directly tests this: technology does NOT predict 2012 levels but DOES predict 2012→2016 shift. This pattern supports the sorting interpretation we emphasize.

**5. Causal language:** We have been careful throughout to emphasize the observational nature of our analysis and favor the sorting interpretation.

## Response to Grok-4.1-Fast

Thank you for the positive assessment.

**1. Missing citations:** Diamond (2016) is now cited in the discussion of geographic sorting. We added this citation explicitly to engage with the skill-sorting mechanism.

**2. Ganong-Knoezer-Shoag (2021):** Good suggestion for regional convergence context; we acknowledge this literature in our discussion of path dependence.

## Response to Gemini-3-Flash

Thank you for the constructive feedback.

**1. Software gap:** This limitation is explicitly discussed in Section 6.5. We agree this is an important caveat.

**2. Migration data:** Outside the scope of our current data, but an excellent direction for future research that could strengthen the sorting interpretation.

**3. Moral values proxy:** We added Section 6.3 testing moral communalism as a mechanism. The null mediation result (zero attenuation) is informative even if our proxy is coarse. We discuss the limitations of our proxy construction transparently.

We believe the paper now addresses the core concerns raised by all three reviewers while maintaining intellectual honesty about the limitations of observational analysis.
