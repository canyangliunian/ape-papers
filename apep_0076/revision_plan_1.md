# Revision Plan - Round 1

Based on internal review feedback (review_cc_1.md).

## Priority Fixes

### 1. Expand Power Analysis (High Priority)
- Add explicit discussion of minimum detectable effects (MDE)
- Calculate what effect size could be ruled out given SE of 2.6%
- Context: 95% CI of [-5.6%, 4.6%] rules out effects larger than ~5%

### 2. Expand Discussion Section (Medium Priority)
- Add 2-3 paragraphs discussing why EITC may not affect property crime
- Mechanisms: timing of payment, targeting, marginal offender profile

### 3. Literature Additions (Low Priority)
- Consider adding Dahl & Lochner (2012) on child outcomes
- Consider adding Nichols & Rothstein (2016) EITC review

## Deferred Items
- Extended sample (pre-1999 crime data): Not feasible with current data source
- Triple-diff design: Would require individual-level data

## Not Changed
- Methodology is sound - no changes needed
- Figures and tables are publication quality
- Statistical inference is complete
