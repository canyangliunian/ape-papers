## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0142
**Parent Title:** Do Energy Efficiency Resource Standards Reduce Electricity Consumption? Evidence from Staggered State Adoption
**Parent Decision:** MINOR REVISION (2/3 reviewers)
**Revision Rationale:** User requested: "Tighten up the paper. Sharper abstract. Stronger motivation and clearer contribution to econ lit."

## Key Changes Planned

1. **Sharper Abstract** - Reduce from 267 to ~150 words; lead with the answer, not the question
2. **Stronger Motivation** - Add "why now" paragraph establishing stakes and evidence gap
3. **Clearer Contributions** - Consolidate into 3 sharp contributions to economics literature
4. **Tighten Throughout** - Cut redundancy in Introduction, Institutional Background, and Discussion

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **GPT-5-mini:** Inference robustness for CS-DiD, treatment coding transparency → Already addressed in V3; this revision focuses on presentation
2. **Gemini-3-Flash:** "Results and Conclusion sections could be further developed" → Actually need tightening, not expansion
3. **Grok-4.1-Fast:** "Lead with welfare" → Will make contributions more prominent

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Do EERS reduce electricity consumption? (same)
- Identification strategy: CS-DiD with never-treated controls (same)
- Primary data source: EIA SEDS + retail sales (same)
- Main result: 4.15% reduction, p<0.01 (same)
