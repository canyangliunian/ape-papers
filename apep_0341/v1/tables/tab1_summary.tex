\footnotesize \textit{Notes:} Summary statistics for the pre-ARPA period (January 2018 to March 2021), covering 1,899 state-months. The full regression panel (Table~\ref{tab:main}) covers 4,161 state-months across the entire 2018--2024 period. Some early-treated cohorts (2018) have post-treatment observations in this pre-ARPA window. Personal care codes include T1019, T1020, S5125, and S5130. ``Treated'' states are those with a detected sustained rate increase of \(\geq\)15\% in average payment per claim. Provider counts are unique billing NPIs per state-month. Two treated states (U.S. Virgin Islands and Vermont) lack pre-ARPA data and are excluded from this table but included in all regressions. They are excluded because they entered the T-MSIS reporting system only after April 2021, providing insufficient pre-treatment baseline for this table; the Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator accommodates their short pre-treatment windows in the regression analysis.
