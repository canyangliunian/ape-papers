# Revision Plan (Stage C)

## Changes Made in Response to Referee Feedback

### Reviewer 1 (GPT-5.2 — Major Revision)
1. **Endogenous treatment detection:** Added extended discussion in Threats to Validity (Section 5.3) addressing the concern that treatment is detected from the same data as outcomes. Added four specific mitigating arguments.
2. **Confidence intervals:** Added 95% CIs for all TWFE coefficients in the results narrative.
3. **Literature:** Added citations for HCBS workforce literature (Montgomery et al. 2019), occupational licensing (Kleiner 2000).
4. **Wyoming outlier:** Excluded from dose-response analysis; added separate robustness check excluding Wyoming from main specification.

### Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast — Minor Revision)
1. **Confidence intervals:** Added to results text for TWFE estimates.
2. **Literature gaps:** Added Montgomery et al. (2019), Kleiner (2000) citations.
3. **Wyoming mentions consolidated:** Streamlined discussion across sections.

### Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash — Minor Revision)
1. **Dose-response endogeneity:** Addressed by excluding Wyoming and noting that the negative relationship reflects responsive policy.
2. **Consolidation mechanism:** Already discussed in heterogeneity section; clarified with proper log-coefficient interpretation.
3. **Literature:** Added occupational licensing reference.

### Exhibit Review Suggestions (Advisory)
