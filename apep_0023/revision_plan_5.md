# Revision Plan - Round 5

## Review Summary

Round 5 identified **no major or moderate issues**. The paper has successfully addressed all substantive concerns from Rounds 1-4 and is ready for publication.

## Minor Issues (Optional)

Three very minor issues were identified, all of which are cosmetic and optional:

1. **Figure 4 FPL notation** - Could add threshold notation to match Figure 1 style
2. **Figure 3 label verification** - Confirm en-dashes render correctly
3. **Table 2 notes spacing** - Stylistic preference only

## Decision

**No mandatory revisions required.**

The paper is publication-ready. The optional cosmetic changes do not materially improve the paper and are left to author discretion.

## Action Items

1. ✓ Verify Figure 3 labels render correctly in PDF (visual inspection confirms fix)
2. Skip optional Figure 4 legend change (current labels are clear)
3. Skip optional Table 2 notes reformatting (current format is standard)
