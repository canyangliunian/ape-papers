# Reply to Reviewers - Round 5 (Final)

## Response to Internal Review

We thank the reviewer for the thorough evaluation across five rounds of review. This final round confirms that all substantive issues have been addressed.

## Review Outcome

**The reviewer has determined the paper is publication-ready.**

Round 5 identified no major or moderate issues. The three minor items flagged are cosmetic preferences that do not affect the substance of the research:

1. **Figure 4 FPL notation** - The reviewer notes this is optional and "current labels are acceptable."
2. **Figure 3 label verification** - Confirmed fixed; en-dashes render correctly.
3. **Table 2 notes spacing** - Described as "negligible (stylistic preference)."

We have elected to leave these as-is, as the current presentation is clear and follows standard conventions.
