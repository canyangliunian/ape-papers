# Reply to Reviewers - Round 3

## Response to Internal Review

We thank the reviewer for the continued thorough feedback. Below we respond to each issue raised in Round 3.

### Major Issues

**1. Expansion Timing Mismatch**

*Reviewer Concern:* Control states expanded Medicaid in 2014, while Montana expanded in 2016. This timing difference could affect identification.

*Response:* We have added a new subsection in Section 4.2.1 titled "Expansion Timing Consideration" that explicitly addresses this concern. The text explains that control states were 2-4 years into expansion while Montana was 0-3 years in during our post-treatment period. We note that the triple-difference design partially addresses this by comparing *changes* in the eligible-to-near-eligible gap rather than levels, but acknowledge that if expansion dynamics evolve differently over the lifecycle, this could affect estimates. This is also discussed in the limitations section.

**2. External Validity Discussion**

*Reviewer Concern:* Montana's demographic atypicality (81% White, rural) was inadequately addressed.

*Response:* We substantially expanded the "Generalizability" caveat in Section 6.2. The revised text explicitly notes:
- Sample is 81% White vs. approximately 60% nationally among adults below 200% FPL
- Montana's labor market characteristics (seasonal agriculture/tourism employment, thin urban sector, geographic isolation)
- How these features could affect generalizability in either direction
- Explicit statement that findings are "suggestive evidence from a specific context rather than nationally generalizable estimates"

### Moderate Issues

**3. Eligibility Threshold Notation**

*Response:* Standardized notation throughout the paper. Now consistently uses "≤138% FPL" or "at or below 138% FPL" rather than "<138% FPL".

**4. Appendix Table Numbering**

*Response:* Fixed LaTeX to properly reset table counter in appendix. Tables now display as "Table A1" and "Table A2" instead of "Table 3" and "Table 4".

**5. Sample Size Precision**

*Response:* Updated text from "approximately 122,000" to exact figure "122,397" to match tables.

**6. Bootstrap P-values Clarification**

*Response:* Updated Table 2 notes to clarify: "Wild cluster bootstrap p-value for the triple-interaction coefficient: 0.024. Bootstrap p-values for other coefficients not reported as they are not the primary focus of this analysis."

**7. R-squared Values**

*Response:* Added R-squared row to Table 2: 0.082 for Basic DDD, 0.147 for With Controls specification.
