# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (self-review)
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Paper:** Sports Betting Employment Effects (Revision of apep_0116)

## Follow-up Assessment

Following the first internal review and extensive advisor review cycles, the paper has addressed key methodological concerns:

1. **Sample period consistency**: Clarified as 2014-2024 throughout
2. **Control group definition**: Explicitly documented use of not-yet-treated controls
3. **2024 identification limitation**: Acknowledged that 2024 cohort contributes no identifiable ATT
4. **iGaming exclusion**: Corrected N from 282 to 293, clarified excluded states
5. **All HonestDiD/Rambachan-Roth claims**: Removed (analysis not implemented)

## Remaining Minor Issues

- Minor rounding differences between abstract and tables (e.g., -0.74 vs -0.7393)
- These are acceptable within rounding conventions

## Assessment

The paper is methodologically sound and ready for external review.
