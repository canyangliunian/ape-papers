## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0201
**Parent Title:** Friends in High Places: How Social Networks Transmit Minimum Wage Shocks
**Parent Decision:** MAJOR REVISION
**Revision Rationale:** Restructure identification around reduced-form event study to resolve pre-trend critique

## Key Changes Planned

1. Reduced-form event study showing clean pre-trends on instrument
2. Distance-credibility analysis table
3. Sun & Abraham interaction-weighted estimator
4. Enhanced Rambachan-Roth sensitivity with M-bar
5. LATE/complier characterization
6. County-specific linear trends robustness
7. Industry heterogeneity (high-bite vs low-bite NAICS)
8. Literature updates and paper trimming

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **All reviewers:** Pre-trend rejection (F(4,50)=3.90, p=0.008) in structural event study -> resolved via reduced-form event study
2. **GPT/Grok:** Sun & Abraham estimator requested -> added
3. **GPT/Grok:** Rambachan-Roth with explicit M-bar -> added
4. **All reviewers:** Industry heterogeneity -> added
5. **Grok:** Trim Discussion -> done

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Social networks and minimum wage spillovers
- Identification strategy: Shift-share IV (SCI shares, MW shocks)
- Primary data source: QWI + Facebook SCI
