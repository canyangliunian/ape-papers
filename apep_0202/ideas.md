## Idea 1: Social Networks and Minimum Wage Spillovers (Revision of apep_0201)

**Policy:** State-level minimum wage increases, 2014-2022 (staggered adoption)
**Outcome:** County-level employment and earnings from QWI (LEHD/Census)
**Identification:** Shift-share IV using Facebook SCI as shares, out-of-state MW changes as shocks
**Why it's novel:** First paper to use social network exposure (Facebook SCI) as a channel for minimum wage spillovers across labor markets
**Feasibility check:** Confirmed: rich state × time variation, QWI data accessible, SCI available, not previously studied in this framework

### Revision Focus
This revision restructures the identification argument around the **reduced-form event study**, which shows no pre-trend problem (p=0.207) using exclusively out-of-state identifying variation, resolving the main critique that the OLS event study rejects parallel trends (F(4,50)=3.90, p=0.008).
