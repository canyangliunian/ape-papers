\footnotesize\textit{Notes:} Summary statistics for the county-year panel, 2000--2024. ``High Flood'' counties have above-median pre-treatment (pre-1992) FEMA flood declarations within their state, conditional on having at least one declaration. ZHVI is the Zillow Home Value Index (typical home value, seasonally adjusted). Flood Declarations is the count of unique FEMA major disaster declarations for flood events in 1953--1991.
