# Internal Review Round 1

**Verdict: MINOR REVISION**

## Summary
The paper presents a well-designed triple-difference study of flood risk disclosure laws and housing values. The main finding (precisely estimated null) is credible and interesting.

## Key Issues Identified and Fixed
1. **Table formatting**: Table 2 had misaligned coefficients (first value appeared as row label). Fixed by adding proper row labels.
2. **Inconsistent terminology**: Table notes referred to "top tertile" while text said "above-median." Standardized to "above-median."
3. **CS-DiD pre-trends**: Figure 2 shows significant pre-trends at k=-5 and k=-4, but text claimed "near zero." Corrected text to honestly describe pre-trend violations.
4. **2024 adopters**: Four states with only one post-treatment year. Added explicit discussion in Panel Construction.
5. **Sample period inconsistency**: Mixed "1997-2024" and "2000-2024." Standardized to "2000-2024."
6. **Prose improvements**: Strengthened opening hook, translated coefficients to dollar amounts, fixed column-itis in Results.
7. **Moved Table 4 to appendix** per exhibit review recommendation.

## Remaining Issues
- Consider adding a map figure showing geographic distribution of treated states
- Wave heterogeneity figure could be consolidated into Table 3
