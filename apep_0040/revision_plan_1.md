# Revision Plan - Round 1

## Response to Internal Review

### Major Revision 1: Reframe as Descriptive Evidence

**Action:** Update abstract, introduction, and conclusion to clearly state this is primarily descriptive evidence on the correlates of incorporation, with causal interpretation requiring strong assumptions.

**Changes:**
- Abstract: Already states "results are most informative as high-quality descriptive evidence" - make this more prominent
- Introduction: Add paragraph explicitly discussing identification challenges
- Conclusion: Emphasize that causal claims require assumptions that may not hold

### Major Revision 2: Discuss Measurement Issues

**Action:** Add discussion of ACS class-of-worker measurement limitations

**Changes:**
- Add paragraph in Data section about classification issues (LLCs, measurement error)
- Note that misclassification likely attenuates the true gap

### Major Revision 3: Address Simultaneity More Directly

**Action:** Expand discussion of reverse causality in identification section

**Changes:**
- Add specific discussion of tax optimization incentive creating reverse causality
- Note that high earners have greater incentive to incorporate

### Minor Revision 1: Heterogeneity with Adjustment

**Action:** Note in heterogeneity table that these are raw differences

**Changes:**
- Already noted in table - ensure caption is clear

### Minor Revision 2: Industry Norms

**Action:** Add discussion of industry-specific incorporation patterns

**Changes:**
- Add brief discussion in Background section

## Implementation

I will make these revisions directly to the paper.tex file.
