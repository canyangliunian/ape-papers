# Revision Plan - Round 4

## Key Issues (Round 3 Review)

The fundamental limitation (no quasi-experimental variation) cannot be addressed with ACS data. The paper will remain descriptive. Focus on polish:

### Issue 1: Remove "ATT" Language

Replace all references to "ATT" with "adjusted association" or "conditional difference."

### Issue 2: "$43,000" Inconsistency

Reviewer notes "$43,000" appears somewhere - should be $41,350 consistently.

### Issue 3: Add CIs to Heterogeneity Table

Add 95% CIs to Table 4 for completeness.

## Changes

1. Search and replace ATT language in Conceptual Framework
2. Check for any "$43,000" references
3. Add CIs to heterogeneity table
