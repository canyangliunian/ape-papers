# Reply to Reviewers - Round 2

## Response to GPT 5.2 External Review

We thank the reviewer for the detailed and constructive feedback. The review identified critical issues that have substantially improved the manuscript. Below we address each major concern.

---

### 1. Internal Inconsistencies (Sample Size and Coefficient Magnitudes)

**Reviewer concern:** Sample sizes inconsistent (136,000 vs. 150,000 vs. 135,952), coefficient magnitudes inconsistent (Table 2 shows $23,843 but Appendix Table 5 showed $30,000).

**Response:** We have corrected all inconsistencies. The paper now consistently reports:
- **Sample size:** 135,952 throughout (this is the actual analysis sample)
- **Preferred estimate:** $23,843 consistently in abstract, main text, and all appendix tables
- **Confidence intervals:** Added 95% CIs to main results ($22,416–$25,270)

All appendix tables have been updated to match the main results.

### 2. Incomplete Inference (Heterogeneity Table)

**Reviewer concern:** Table 4 (heterogeneity) lacked standard errors and confidence intervals.

**Response:** Table 4 now includes:
- Standard errors for all subgroup estimates
- Explicit sample sizes (exact, not approximate)
- Note clarifying these are conditional estimates from specification (3)

### 3. Identification Framing (Causal vs. Descriptive)

**Reviewer concern:** Paper oscillates between causal ATT framing and descriptive framing without choosing a lane.

**Response:** We have committed fully to descriptive framing:
- **Title changed:** "Does Business Structure Causally Affect..." → "Descriptive Evidence on Business Structure and..."
- **Abstract rewritten:** Now explicitly states "descriptive evidence" and "descriptive correlations, not causal estimates"
- **Introduction reframed:** Opens with "correlate" rather than causal language; explicitly acknowledges the cross-sectional design cannot identify causation
- **Discussion/Conclusion:** Consistently uses "conditional association" rather than "effect" or "premium"

### 4. Thin Literature

**Reviewer concern:** Only 9 references; missing key foundational works.

**Response:** The bibliography has been expanded from 9 to 19 references, adding:
- **Propensity score foundations:** Rosenbaum & Rubin (1983), Hirano, Imbens & Ridder (2003)
- **Program evaluation:** Imbens & Wooldridge (2009)
- **Sensitivity analysis:** Altonji, Elder & Taber (2005), Oster (2019), Rosenbaum (2002)
- **Pass-through taxation:** Cooper et al. (2016), Cullen & Gordon (2007), Gordon & Slemrod (2000)
- **Modern entrepreneurship:** Levine & Rubinstein (2017)

The Related Literature section has been substantially expanded with deeper engagement with these works.

### 5. Section 2 Bullet Lists

**Reviewer concern:** Institutional background relies heavily on bullet lists rather than analytical prose.

**Response:** Section 2 has been completely rewritten in flowing paragraphs that integrate institutional details analytically rather than enumerating them as lists.

---

### 6. Hours Worked as Bad Control

**Reviewer concern:** Conditioning on hours worked is problematic if hours is a mediator (post-treatment).

**Response:** We have added an explicit discussion in the Limitations section addressing this concern:
- Acknowledged that if incorporation affects hours, conditioning on hours changes the estimand
- Noted that specification (2) without hours yields $29,491
- Explained the empirical ambiguity about whether hours is confounder or mediator
- Recommended readers focus on different specifications depending on their prior beliefs

---

### 7. Paper Length

**Reviewer concern:** ~16 pages is below the 25-page expectation.

**Response:** The paper has been expanded to 19 pages through:
- Expanded literature review
- More developed institutional background
- Additional discussion of limitations
- Fuller exposition in methods section

We acknowledge this still falls short of 25 pages; further expansion would require additional analysis or new data, which we defer to future work.

---

### 8. Design Recommendations

**Reviewer concern:** Paper needs panel/event-study design or quasi-experimental variation for causal claims.

**Response:** We agree. The paper has been repositioned as purely descriptive. We have:
- Removed causal language throughout
- Added explicit acknowledgment that panel data or policy variation would be needed for causal identification
- Framed the contribution as establishing a stylized fact and demonstrating sensitivity analysis methods

## Summary of Changes

| Issue | Action Taken |
|-------|--------------|
| Sample size inconsistency | Fixed to 135,952 throughout |
| Coefficient inconsistency | All tables now show $23,843 |
| Missing CIs | Added 95% CIs to main results |
| Missing SEs in heterogeneity | Added SEs to Table 4 |
| Causal framing | Completely reframed as descriptive |
