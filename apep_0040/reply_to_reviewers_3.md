# Reply to Reviewers - Round 3

## Response to GPT 5.2 External Review Round 2

### 1. Novelty vs. Levine & Rubinstein (2017)

**Response:** Added explicit paragraph distinguishing this paper from L&R 2017:
- L&R uses NLSY79 cohort data (1957-1964 birth cohort); we use 2022 ACS (nationally representative)
- L&R focuses on selection mechanism (ability → incorporation and earnings); we focus on sensitivity analysis methods
- L&R leverages panel data and ability measures; we show what can be learned from cross-sectional data

### 2. Outcome is PINCP (includes non-business income)

**Response:** Added footnote acknowledging this limitation:
- ACS does not separately identify self-employment income for incorporated workers
- Incorporated workers report wages from their corporation, not self-employment income
- Administrative data would be needed for cleaner outcome measurement

### 3. Missing State FE

**Response:** Added column (5) with state FE to Table 2:
- Estimate falls from $19,301 (industry FE) to $18,547 (industry + state FE)
- Added discussion noting this represents most conservative estimate

### 4. ACS Replicate Weights

**Response:** Added explicit acknowledgment in Data section:
- Note that we use robust SEs rather than ACS replicate weights
- Cite Solon, Haider & Wooldridge (2015) on weighting in regression
- Note that with N > 135,000, choice of variance estimator has minimal practical impact

### 5. Missing References

**Response:** Added:
- Gordon & MacKie-Mason (1994) on tax distortions and organizational form
- Goolsbee (2004) on corporate tax and organizational form
- Solon, Haider & Wooldridge (2015) on weighting

Bibliography expanded from 19 to 22 references.

### 6. Paper Length

Paper expanded from 19 to 20 pages through additional content in literature review, main results discussion, and data section.

## Summary

The paper now:
- Clearly differentiates from Levine & Rubinstein (2017)
- Acknowledges PINCP measurement limitation
- Includes state FE in main table
- Documents weighting approach with citation
- Has expanded literature coverage
