## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages, excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The manuscript shows numbered pages up to **24** before the References section begins (“References” starts on p. **24** and continues to p. **26**). That implies the **main text is ~23 pages** (or at most 24 including the section header), **below 25 pages excluding references**.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
   - I count **19** bibliography entries (Angrist & Lavy 1999 through Sommers et al. 2012).

3. **Prose Quality (complete paragraphs; no bullet points in key sections)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Related Literature, Results, and Discussion are written in paragraph form (no bullet lists).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has ≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, and Conclusion each contain multiple substantive paragraphs (with subsections in Data/Methods/Results providing additional depth).

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not empty/broken)**: **FAIL**  
   - In the provided manuscript rendering, **Figure 1 and Figure 2 appear as axes/labels without visible plotted points/lines** (they look like empty frames in the text extract). If this reflects the actual PDF output (rather than a copy/paste artifact), the figures are **not publication-ready** and should be fixed to clearly display the binned means and any fitted lines/CI bands.

6. **Tables (real numbers; no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - All tables shown contain numeric entries (no “TBD/XXX” placeholders).

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Insufficient main-text length**: Expand the body of the paper to reach **≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix** (e.g., more institutional detail, clearer validation/diagnostics, richer robustness, stronger discussion of measurement/first-stage issues, and/or an appendix that is explicitly excluded from the count but with the main text meeting the requirement).
2. **Figures appear broken/empty**: Ensure **Figures 1–2 render with visible data** (points/lines), readable axes, and publication-quality formatting in the compiled PDF. If the figures are fine in the PDF and this is only a text-extraction issue, still provide figures in a form reviewers can verify (embedded raster/vector images).

Per your instructions, I’m **not proceeding to Phase 2 (content review)** until these format issues are addressed.
