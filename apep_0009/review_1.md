## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excl. refs/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The PDF text shown is numbered through **p. 19** and includes the References on p. 18–19. That implies the main text is well **under 25 pages** (likely ~17 pages excluding references), so it does not meet the minimum length requirement.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **FAIL**  
   - The bibliography lists **11** items (Autor & Duggan; Cahuc et al.; Card et al.; Fetter & Lockwood; French; Gelber et al.; Gruber; Imbens & Lemieux; Lee & Lemieux; Manoli & Weber). This is **below 15**.

3. **Prose Quality (complete paragraphs; no bullet points in key sections)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Related Literature, Results, and Discussion appear written in standard paragraph form (no bullet-point structure shown).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has ≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, and Conclusion each contain multiple substantive paragraphs in the provided text.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; none broken/empty)**: **PASS (but missing figures)**  
   - No figures are shown in the provided excerpt. Therefore none appear broken/empty. However, for an RDD paper, the absence of standard RD plots is a major presentation omission (even if it’s not a “broken figure” issue).

6. **Tables (all tables have real numbers; no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables shown (Tables 1–6) contain numerical entries; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders are visible.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Paper is too short** relative to the stated minimum standard (needs **≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix**).  
2. **Bibliography is too small** (**11 references**, needs **≥ 15**).  

(Strong recommendation, though not strictly triggered by the Phase-1 checklist item as written: add core RDD figures—RD binned scatterplots with fits, density test plots, and covariate balance plots—since an RDD paper without RD graphs is typically not review-ready.)

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until these format issues are addressed.
