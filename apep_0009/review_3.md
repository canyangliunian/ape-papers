## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The manuscript shows page numbers up to **26**, but **“References” begins after the conclusion on p. 24**. That implies the **main text is ~24 pages**, which is **below the 25-page minimum** *excluding references*.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
   - I count **~19 references** (Angrist & Lavy; Autor & Duggan; Cahuc et al.; Card et al. 2008, 2009; Coile & Gruber; Currie; Fetter & Lockwood; French; Gelber et al.; Gelman & Imbens; Gruber; Imbens & Lemieux; Kleven & Kopczuk; Lee & Lemieux; Manoli & Weber; Mastrobuoni; Moffitt; Sommers et al.).

3. **Prose Quality (complete paragraphs; no bullet-point sections)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature, Results, Discussion are written in paragraphs (no bullet formatting).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section ≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **FAIL**  
   - **Conclusion (Section 10)** is **too short** (reads like ~2 paragraphs) and does not meet the “3–4 substantive paragraphs” requirement.  
   - Other major sections appear to meet the threshold, but this single violation triggers a FAIL.

5. **Figures (all contain visible data; not empty/broken)**: **PASS**  
   - Figures 1–2 show plotted points by age with a cutoff line; they are not empty. (They are not publication-quality, but the Phase 1 requirement is “visible data,” which they satisfy.)

6. **Tables (real numbers; no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables contain numeric estimates, SEs, means, and Ns; no “TBD/XXX”.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Increase main-text length to ≥ 25 pages excluding references.**  
   - You are currently at **~24 pages of main text** (references start after p. 24). Add at least ~1+ page of substantive content (not just spacing).

2. **Expand the Conclusion to ≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs.**  
   - Add: (i) a clearer recap of identification + first-stage implications, (ii) policy interpretation given weak take-up/measurement, (iii) a limitations paragraph tied to discrete running variable/age heaping/ACS measurement, and (iv) concrete next-step research designs/data sources.

Per your instructions, I’m **not proceeding to Phase 2** until these format problems are corrected.
