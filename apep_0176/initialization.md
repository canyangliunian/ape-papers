## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0174
**Parent Title:** Shining Light on Nothing? Null Effects of Salary Transparency Laws on New Hire Wages
**Parent Decision:** Polish revision requested by user
**Revision Rationale:** User requested prose polish, especially in introduction which "doesn't read like a proper econ paper"

## Key Changes Planned

- Rewrite introduction for more elegant, flowing prose typical of top journals
- Improve sentence structure and transitions throughout
- Polish academic tone and framing
- Maintain all substantive content and findings

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

This revision addresses user feedback rather than formal reviewer concerns:
1. **User:** "Intro is still a bit clunky" → Rewrite for elegance
2. **User:** "Doesn't read like a proper econ paper" → Adopt AER-style prose conventions
3. **User:** "Prose" → General prose polish throughout

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Same (salary transparency effects on wages/gender gaps)
- Identification strategy: Same (Callaway-Sant'Anna DiD)
- Primary data source: Same (Census QWI)
- All empirical findings: Unchanged
