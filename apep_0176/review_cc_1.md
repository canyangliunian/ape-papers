# Internal Review - Round 1

## Review Summary

This paper examines the effect of salary transparency laws on new hire wages using Census QWI data and modern DiD methods. The prose revision successfully addresses the main concern about readability.

## Format Check
- **Length**: ~27 pages main text (adequate)
- **References**: Comprehensive coverage of DiD methodology and pay transparency literature
- **Prose**: Introduction now reads like a proper economics paper with flowing paragraphs
- **Figures/Tables**: Publication quality

## Statistical Methodology
- Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator correctly applied for staggered adoption
- Standard errors clustered at state level (17 clusters)
- Border design properly decomposed into levels vs. changes
- Placebo tests and robustness checks adequate

## Identification
- Parallel trends assumption supported by event study
- Proper handling of forbidden comparisons in DiD
- Clear discussion of limitations

## Writing Quality
The revised introduction is substantially improved:
- Opens with compelling narrative hook (Colorado's 2021 law)
- Acknowledges prior empirical evidence (Cullen & Pakzad-Hurson, Baker et al., Bennedsen et al.)
- Explains why this intervention differs from previous studies
- Proper academic tone throughout

## Decision
The paper meets publication standards after prose revision.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
