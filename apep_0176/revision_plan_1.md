# Revision Plan 1 - Prose Polish

## Revision Focus

This revision addresses user feedback requesting prose improvements, specifically:
- "Intro is still a bit clunky"
- "Doesn't read like a proper econ paper"
- "Prose"

## Changes Made

### 1. Introduction Rewrite

**Before:** The introduction opened abruptly ("Eight U.S. states mandated salary transparency between 2021 and 2024. Advocates promised pay equity; critics warned of wage suppression. Both were wrong.") and proceeded in a choppy, bullet-point-like style.

**After:** The introduction now:
- Opens with a compelling narrative hook about Colorado's 2021 law
- Flows naturally through the theoretical stakes using full paragraphs
- **Critically:** Acknowledges existing empirical evidence (Cullen & Pakzad-Hurson 2023, Baker et al. 2023, Bennedsen et al. 2022) before explaining why this paper's contribution differs
- Frames the null result as a puzzle relative to prior positive findings rather than simply claiming "theory predicts X, I find nothing"
- Uses sophisticated transitions between paragraphs
- Concludes with properly academic roadmap

### 2. Author Line Fix

Fixed duplicate "Correspondence" in author footnote.

### 3. Title Footnote Update

Updated revision reference from apep_0172 to apep_0174.

## No Substantive Changes

- All empirical results unchanged
- All methodology unchanged
- All tables and figures unchanged
- Literature review section unchanged (prior evidence was already discussed there; now also acknowledged in intro)

## Reviewer Feedback Note

This revision was motivated by user feedback on prose quality, not formal peer review. The external reviews received during this revision cycle (GPT: Major Revision, Grok: Minor Revision, Gemini: Minor Revision) request additional robustness analyses that are pre-existing concerns from the parent paper, not new issues introduced by the prose edits.
