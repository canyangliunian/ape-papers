# Reply to Reviewers - Revision 1

## Context

This revision addressed user feedback specifically requesting prose polish ("intro is still a bit clunky, doesn't read like a proper econ paper"). The changes are limited to improving the writing quality of the introduction, with no changes to empirical content.

## Response to User Feedback

**Concern:** "Intro is still a bit clunky, doesn't read like a proper econ paper. Prose."

**Response:** We have substantially rewritten the introduction to meet the prose standards of top economics journals. Key improvements:

1. **Opening Hook:** The paper now opens with a narrative about Colorado's January 2021 law rather than blunt summary statistics.

2. **Prior Evidence Acknowledged:** We added a full paragraph discussing existing empirical work (Cullen & Pakzad-Hurson 2023 on right-to-ask laws, Baker et al. 2023 on internal disclosure, Bennedsen et al. 2022 on Denmark's gap reporting) and explaining why our intervention differs. This addresses the implicit suggestion that the original draft read as if no prior empirical evidence existed.

3. **Improved Flow:** Sentences are longer and more varied; paragraphs transition naturally; the contribution section reads as prose rather than bullet points.

4. **Framing:** The null result is now positioned relative to prior positive findings, creating a puzzle rather than simply asserting theory failure.

## Response to External Referee Feedback

The external reviews received during this revision cycle raised methodological concerns that predate the current prose revision:

**GPT-5-mini (Major Revision):**
- Requests wild cluster bootstrap inference, not-yet-treated controls sensitivity, and concurrent policy controls
- **Response:** These are valid concerns carried over from the parent paper. They do not affect the prose polish that was the focus of this revision. Future revisions may address them.

**Grok-4.1-Fast (Minor Revision):**
- Minor formatting and citation suggestions
- **Response:** Noted for future revision.

**Gemini-3-Flash (Minor Revision):**
- Suggests additional heterogeneity analyses
- **Response:** Noted for future revision.
