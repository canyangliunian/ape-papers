## Idea 1: Climate Policy Feedback in Swiss Referendums (SELECTED - Revision)

**Policy:** Swiss cantonal energy laws (MuKEn) adopted 2010-2017 in five cantons (GR, BE, AG, BL, BS)

**Outcome:** May 2017 Energy Strategy 2050 federal referendum vote shares at Gemeinde level

**Identification:** Spatial RDD at internal canton borders comparing treated vs. control municipalities

**Why it's novel:** Tests policy feedback in direct democracy setting with clean geographic variation

**Feasibility check:** Confirmed: Data available via swissdd package, canton borders computable from BFS shapefiles

**Revision focus:** Fix identification concerns from parent paper (border pooling, inference, placebos)
