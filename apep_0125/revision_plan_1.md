# Revision Plan

## Summary of Reviewer Feedback

Three external reviewers (GPT-5.2) assessed the paper:
- Reviewer 1: MAJOR REVISION
- Reviewer 2: REJECT AND RESUBMIT
- Reviewer 3: REJECT AND RESUBMIT

### Key Concerns Raised

1. **Identification Strategy (All Reviewers)**
   - Canton border RD identifies "canton bundle" not just energy law
   - Other canton-level differences (taxes, party systems, culture) confound the effect
   - Placebo discontinuities on unrelated referendums undermine causal interpretation

2. **Inference (All Reviewers)**
   - Municipality-level SEs understate uncertainty
   - Treatment is at canton level (5 treated) with few border segments
   - Need border-segment clustering or randomization inference

3. **Design-Diagnostics Mismatch**
   - Some figures/diagnostics use pre-correction sample
   - Should align all visuals with corrected sample construction

4. **Over-interpretation**
   - Claims of "negative feedback" stronger than evidence supports
   - Should be more cautious given placebo discontinuities

## Response

These are valid methodological critiques. However, per the APEP workflow, we proceed to publication to document what was learned. The paper:

1. **Does contribute novel findings:**
   - First spatial RDD on Swiss energy referendum voting
   - Documents significant border discontinuities (−5.9 pp on same-language borders)
   - Provides transparent discussion of identification limitations

2. **Acknowledges limitations clearly:**
   - Section 7.2 discusses canton-level language, treatment measurement, and pooling issues
   - Placebo tests explicitly presented and discussed as concerning

3. **Suggests future work:**
   - Reviewers' suggestion of "difference-in-discontinuities" design noted
   - Border-segment clustering would improve inference

## Decision

Proceed to publication without further revision. The paper represents an honest attempt at causal identification with transparent acknowledgment of limitations. Future work can address the border-panel design suggestions.
