## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix): FAIL**  
   - Approximate pagination from the PDF text: main narrative runs to about **p. 21** (“Conclusion” ends on p. 21), with **References starting on p. 22** and the **Appendix around p. 24–25**.  
   - That implies the main text is roughly **~21 pages (or fewer if References begin before p. 22 in the compiled version)**, which is **below 25 pages** excluding references/appendix.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography): PASS**  
   - The bibliography lists approximately **19** distinct entries (Autor et al.; Bound & Holzer; Callaway & Sant’Anna; Federman et al.; Goodman-Bacon; Greenwood; Haslag & Weagley; Johnson & Kleiner 2014; Johnson & Kleiner 2018; Kaplan & Schulhofer-Wohl; Kennan & Walker; Kleiner 2006; Kleiner 2015; Markowitz et al.; Molloy et al.; Moretti; Notowidigdo; Obama WH; Oh & Kleiner; Pizzola & Tabarrok; Thornton & Timmons).  
   - Even if one or two are working papers, the count clears the threshold.

3. **Prose Quality (no bullets in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): PASS**  
   - **Introduction, Related Literature, Results, Discussion** are written in paragraph prose. No bullet formatting appears in those sections.

4. **Section Completeness (≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs in each major section): PASS**  
   - **Introduction**: multiple substantive paragraphs.  
   - **Literature**: multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Data**: multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Methods/Empirical Strategy**: multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Results**: multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Conclusion**: ~4 substantive paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all figures show visible data; not broken/empty): PASS**  
   - Figure 1 shows a time-series line with a clear discontinuity; axes and data are visible.  
   - Figure 2 shows state bars (green/gray) with visible variation and a readable axis.  
   - Figure 3 shows pre/post bars for groups with visible differences.

6. **Tables (no placeholders; real numbers): PASS**  
   - Table 1 and Table 2 contain numeric values.  
   - Table 3 contains adoption years/FIPS codes (real values).  
   - Table 4 contains occupation codes and labels (not placeholders).

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Main-text length is below the 25-page minimum (excluding references/appendix).**  
   - You need to expand the *core manuscript* (not just references/appendix) by roughly **4–8 pages** to clearly exceed 25 pages of substantive content.

If you revise to meet the length requirement (e.g., adding a fuller institutional/policy section on heterogeneity in ULR statutes, a more formal event-study/DiD robustness section, additional specifications/diagnostics, and/or an expanded limitations/interpretation section), I can then proceed to **Phase 2 (content review)**.
