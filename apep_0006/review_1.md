## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excl. references/appendix): FAIL**  
   - The PDF excerpt shows main text ending around p.16, references on p.17, and appendix tables on p.18–19. That’s **~19 pages total including references/appendix**, and **~16 pages of main text**. This is well below the 25-page requirement.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography): FAIL**  
   - The bibliography lists **10** items (Callaway & Sant’Anna; Goodman-Bacon; Johnson & Kleiner 2014; Johnson & Kleiner 2018; Kennan & Walker; Kleiner 2006; Kleiner 2015; Markowitz et al.; Molloy et al.; Notowidigdo; Oh & Kleiner 2024 = actually that’s 11?).
   - Careful recount from the visible list:  
     1) Callaway & Sant’Anna (2021)  
     2) Goodman-Bacon (2021)  
     3) Johnson & Kleiner (2014)  
     4) Johnson & Kleiner (2018)  
     5) Kennan & Walker (2011)  
     6) Kleiner (2006)  
     7) Kleiner (2015)  
     8) Markowitz et al. (2017)  
     9) Molloy et al. (2011)  
     10) Notowidigdo (2011)  
     11) Oh & Kleiner (2024)  
   - That is **11 references**, still **< 15**, so FAIL.

3. **Prose Quality (complete paragraphs; no bullets in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): PASS**  
   - The Introduction, Related Literature, Results, and Discussion sections appear to be written in paragraph prose (no bullet formatting visible).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs): PASS**  
   - **Introduction (Sec. 1):** multiple paragraphs.  
   - **Literature (Sec. 3):** multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Data (Sec. 5):** multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Methods (Sec. 6):** multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Results (Sec. 7):** multiple paragraphs across subsections.  
   - **Conclusion (Sec. 9):** multiple paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not empty/broken): PASS**  
   - Figure 1 shows a time series with points/line; Figure 2 shows a bar chart; Figure 3 shows grouped bars. Axes and data are visible and not obviously broken.

6. **Tables (all tables have real numbers; no placeholders): PASS**  
   - Table 1 and Table 2 contain numeric values; Table 3 and Table 4 are categorical listings. No “TBD/XXX” placeholders observed.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Paper is too short** relative to the ≥25 pages (excluding references/appendix) requirement. You need substantially more main-text material (e.g., richer institutional detail, clearer econometric implementation, robustness, alternative specifications, additional results/appendices) to reach a typical journal working-paper length.
2. **Bibliography is too thin**: only **~11 citations**, below the **≥15** threshold. The literature review and references must be expanded to include more of the occupational licensing/mobility/telehealth/DiD staggered-adoption literature and closely related empirical work.

Per your instructions, I will **not** proceed to Phase 2 (content review) until these format problems are addressed.
