## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - Approximate page count: the main text appears to run through the end of Section 10 (“Conclusion”) on about **p. 24**, with **References** starting immediately after and the **Appendix** following (pages ~26–28). That implies **~24 pages or fewer of main text**, i.e., **under 25** once references/appendix are excluded.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations)**: **PASS**  
   - Bibliography appears to contain **~21 references** (Autor et al.; Bound & Holzer; Callaway & Sant’Anna; Federman et al.; Goodman-Bacon; Greenwood; Haslag & Weagley; Johnson & Kleiner (2); Kaplan & Schulhofer-Wohl; Kennan & Walker; Kleiner (2); Markowitz et al.; Molloy et al.; Moretti; Notowidigdo; Obama WH; Oh & Kleiner; Pizzola & Tabarrok; Thornton & Timmons).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **PASS**  
   - These sections are written in paragraph form (subsection headings and enumerated “Predictions” appear, but not bullet-point lists in the checked sections).

4. **Section Completeness (≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs each)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature, Data, Empirical Strategy, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion all appear to have multiple substantive paragraphs.

5. **Figures (visible data, not broken/empty)**: **PASS**  
   - Figures shown (time series line chart; state bar chart; pre/post bar chart) contain visible plotted data and labeled axes.

6. **Tables (real numbers, no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables include concrete values (means, percentages, adoption years, OCCP codes), no “TBD/XXX”.

### PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

**Must-fix issue(s) before content review:**
- **Main-text length is below the required threshold.** Expand the paper so that the body (excluding references and appendix) is **at least 25 pages**. Practically, you likely need **~1–3 additional pages** of substantive content (e.g., expanded identification discussion, more robustness checks, additional heterogeneity, or clearer event-study/alternative estimators discussion).

Per your instructions, I’m **not proceeding to Phase 2** until the format issue above is corrected.
