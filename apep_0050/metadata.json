  "abstract": "Between 2021 and 2025, thirteen U.S. states adopted laws requiring employers to disclose salary ranges in job postings. Using a difference-in-differences design with staggered adoption, we estimate the effect of these salary transparency laws on wage outcomes. Drawing on CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Group data covering over 1.1 million workers from 2016-2024, we find that transparency laws are associated with a statistically significant 4.2 log point decrease in weekly earnings. We find suggestive evidence that the gender wage gap narrows in treated states, with a 1.2 percentage point reduction, though this effect is not statistically significant. However, significant pre-trend violations in the event study raise concerns about the parallel trends assumption.",
