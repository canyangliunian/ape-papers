# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Reviewer 2 Mode)
**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Paper:** Salary Transparency Laws and Wage Outcomes (Revised)

## Changes Since Round 1

The authors have:
1. Added HonestDiD-style sensitivity analysis (Figure 13, Table 11)
2. Added comparison group composition analysis (Figure 14, Table 12)
3. Total exhibits: 14 figures, 12 tables

## Assessment of Revisions

### Pre-Trend Concerns (Previously Major Issue)

**Status: PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**

The sensitivity analysis shows:
- Breakdown point at M_bar = 0.01
- The observed pre-trend violation (0.027) exceeds this threshold
- This means the CI includes zero at the observed level of pre-trend violation

**Interpretation:** This is honest reporting. The results are SUGGESTIVE but not robust to parallel trends violations at observed levels. The paper should emphasize this limitation prominently.

### Comparison Group Analysis

**Status: ADDRESSED**

Figure 14 clearly shows the control group composition over time:
- 42 never-treated states provide stable comparison
- Not-yet-treated states shrink over time as they adopt
- This helps readers understand the identification strategy

---

## Remaining Issues

### Critical
1. Paper text not yet updated to incorporate new analyses
2. Sensitivity analysis results should be discussed in Robustness section
3. Caveats about breakdown point should be in Conclusion

### Moderate
1. Still missing explicit discussion of self-employed placebo
2. Literature still missing Rambachan-Roth citation

### Minor
1. Some table formatting could be improved
2. Abstract should note the sensitivity analysis finding

---

## Overall Assessment

The paper has improved with the addition of sensitivity analysis. The key finding now is:

> Salary transparency laws are associated with a 4.2% decline in wages in the point estimate, but this result is NOT ROBUST to parallel trends violations at observed levels. The sensitivity analysis shows the confidence interval includes zero when allowing for trend deviations similar to those observed in the pre-treatment period.

This is a more honest characterization of the results. The contribution remains valuable because:
1. It documents the first large-sample estimates for US transparency laws
2. The methodology (Sun-Abraham) is appropriate
3. The heterogeneity analysis is informative
4. The sensitivity analysis shows exactly how much parallel trends violation would be needed

---

## DECISION: MINOR REVISION

With the sensitivity analysis added, the paper is now methodologically sound. The remaining issues are:
1. Incorporate new analyses into paper text
2. Add missing citations
3. Update abstract and conclusion to reflect caveats

These are minor revisions that don't require additional analysis.

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
