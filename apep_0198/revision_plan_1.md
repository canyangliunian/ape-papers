# Revision Plan

## Key Issues from External Reviews

### GPT-5-mini (Major Revision)
1. **Cross-outcome covariance** — Added discussion of zero-covariance assumption with sensitivity to rho={0.25, 0.50}
2. **Between-study heterogeneity** — Added study-specific MVPF (H&S: 0.88, Egger: 0.85) and discussion of meta-analytic approach
3. **GE multiplier scaling** — Addressed in pecuniary spillover sensitivity table
4. **Fiscal externality accounting** — Added non-recipient FE robustness check

### Grok-4.1-Fast (Minor Revision)
1. **Figures present** — All figures compile correctly
2. **Missing references** — Added Bachas et al. (2021), Gordon & Li (2009), Sun & Abraham (2021)

### Gemini-3-Flash (Minor Revision)
1. **Distributionally weighted MVPF** — Added to welfare weights discussion (omega_R=2.0 -> MVPF~1.75)
2. **Persistence decay** — Already addressed in sensitivity tables
3. **Figure y-axis scaling** — Figures regenerated from corrected code

## Changes Made
- Covariance sensitivity paragraph in §4.6
- Between-study heterogeneity paragraph in §6
- Distributionally weighted MVPF in §3.3
- Non-recipient fiscal externality robustness in §6
