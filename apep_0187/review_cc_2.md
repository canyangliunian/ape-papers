## Review of Revisions

Following Round 1 review, the paper has been revised to address internal consistency issues.

### Issues Addressed:

1. **Sample period consistency**: All references now consistently use 2012-2022 analysis period.

2. **Arithmetic corrections**: Panel dimensions corrected (51 × 44 = 2,244).

3. **Standard error consistency**: Section 8.5 SEs updated to match tables (0.070/0.074).

4. **Coefficient consistency**: Section 7.8 now reports β=0.11 matching Table 8.

5. **Summary statistics clarification**: Table 1 notes now explain panel vs cross-sectional min/max.

### Remaining Minor Issues:

1. **Figure 6 annotation**: The figure file still shows -0.22 vs table's -0.24. This is a minor discrepancy in the figure file itself, not the LaTeX.

2. **Title framing**: Could more explicitly signal this is primarily a data/descriptive contribution given the weak IV.

### Assessment of Current State:

The paper is now internally consistent and ready for external review. The remaining figure annotation issue is cosmetic and does not affect the scientific contribution.
