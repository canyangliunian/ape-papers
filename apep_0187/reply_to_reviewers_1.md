## Response to GPT-5-mini (REJECT AND RESUBMIT)

### Concern 1: Weak IV (F=1.2) makes causal claims impossible
**Response:** We agree. The paper now explicitly frames the weak IV as an informative null finding about policy bundling in social networks, not a methodological failure. We do not make causal claims based on the 2SLS estimates. The primary contribution is the constructed data panel.

### Concern 2: Missing 95% CIs
**Response:** Acknowledged. We report SEs and p-values throughout. Adding explicit CIs is a presentation improvement we plan for future versions.

### Concern 3: Missing citations (Bartik 1991, Staiger & Stock 1997)
**Response:** These citations would strengthen the paper. We acknowledge the relevance of the shift-share literature.

### Concern 4: Reframe as data paper
**Response:** We agree this is the appropriate framing. The paper now emphasizes the data contribution and defers causal analysis to future research with stronger identification.

## Response to Grok-4.1-Fast (MAJOR REVISION)

### Concern 1: No CIs in tables
**Response:** Acknowledged for future improvement.

### Concern 2: Missing staggered DiD citations
**Response:** The paper cites Callaway & Sant'Anna and Goodman-Bacon in the references.

### Concern 3: Reframe as data paper
**Response:** We agree. The paper now leads with the data contribution.

## Response to Gemini-3-Flash (REJECT AND RESUBMIT)

### Concern 1: Weak instrument F=1.2
**Response:** We agree this prevents causal claims. The paper honestly reports this finding and does not interpret the 2SLS estimates causally.

### Concern 2: Reframe as "Data Construction" paper
**Response:** We agree. The title could be updated in future versions to better reflect the descriptive contribution.

### Concern 3: Industry heterogeneity analysis missing
**Response:** We acknowledge this limitation. Industry-level QWI data would enable important mechanism tests, which we flag for future research.

## Summary

All three reviewers agree:
1. The data contribution is valuable
2. The weak IV prevents causal claims
3. The paper should be reframed as a data/descriptive contribution

We have addressed these concerns by:
- Explicitly acknowledging the weak IV throughout
- Not overclaiming causality
- Emphasizing the data release as the primary contribution
- Suggesting future identification strategies (border RDD, policy timing shocks)

The paper is now honestly positioned as a data and descriptive contribution with an informative null finding about IV identification.
