## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The document shown runs to ~20 pages total *including* references and appendix. The main text appears to be ~17–18 pages, which is below the 25-page requirement.

2. **References (≥15 citations in bibliography)**: **FAIL**  
   - The bibliography lists **7** references (Callaway & Sant’Anna; Dee et al.; Morisi; Neumark & Wascher; Ruhm; Shope; Williams & Shults), which is below 15.

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit Review/Results/Discussion)**: **FAIL**  
   - The paper uses bullet/numbered lists in core narrative sections, including:
     - **Section 2.1** lists “common restrictions” as numbered bullets.
     - **Section 2.2** lists occupations as bullets.
     - **Section 5.2** presents key interpretation points as a numbered list.
   - This violates the “complete paragraphs (not bullet points)” requirement.

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **FAIL**  
   - Several major sections are not developed to 3–4 substantive paragraphs in paragraph form:
     - **Data (Section 3)** is largely structured as lists and brief descriptions rather than multiple developed paragraphs.
     - **Conclusion (Section 7)** appears to be ~2 paragraphs.
     - A dedicated **Literature Review** section is effectively missing (Section 2 is “Background” and is not a developed literature review with multiple paragraphs positioning contributions vs. prior work).

5. **Figures (visible data; not empty/broken)**: **PASS**  
   - The event-study figure and the triple-difference decomposition figure shown contain plotted series/points and confidence shading; axes and labels appear present.

6. **Tables (real numbers; no placeholders like TBD/XXX)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables shown (summary stats; main regression; heterogeneity) contain numeric values and standard errors; no obvious placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Increase length** to at least **25 pages of main text** (excluding references/appendix). This likely requires expanding: literature review, institutional details, identification discussion, robustness/mechanisms, and interpretation.
2. **Expand bibliography to ≥15 references**, including both domain literature (GDL, teen labor markets) and modern DiD/event-study methodology.
3. **Convert bullet lists into paragraph prose** in Introduction/Literature/Results/Discussion (and ideally throughout). If lists are necessary, embed them as prose or move them to an appendix.
4. **Ensure each major section** (Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion) has **3–4 substantive paragraphs** written in standard academic prose, with a real literature review section that positions the contribution.

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until these format issues are addressed.
