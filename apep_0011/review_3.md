## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

### 1) **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix)**  
**FAIL.** The document appears to run to ~20 pages total (page numbers shown through 20). Excluding references and the data appendix, the main text is substantially shorter than 25 pages (roughly ~17–18 pages).

### 2) **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**  
**FAIL.** The bibliography lists **7** references (Callaway & Sant’Anna; Dee et al.; Morisi; Neumark & Wascher; Ruhm; Shope; Williams & Shults), which is below 15.

### 3) **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit Review/Results/Discussion)**  
**FAIL.** Multiple required sections use bullet points instead of prose paragraphs, including:
- **Introduction** (contributions presented as “First/Second/Third” style, and later bullet-like structuring)
- **Background** (Section 2.1 has numbered lists; Section 2.2 has bullet lists of occupations)
- **Results** (Section 5.2 lists features 1–4; similar enumerations recur)
- **Discussion/Limitations** (Section 6.3 uses a numbered list)

This violates the “complete paragraphs (not bullet points)” requirement.

### 4) **Section Completeness (each major section has ≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**  
**FAIL.** Several major sections are not 3–4 substantive paragraphs in continuous prose (they rely heavily on lists/brief subsections). In particular:
- **Data** is mostly structured as short subsections and bullets.
- **Results** includes brief table/figure descriptions and enumerated bullets rather than sustained paragraphs.
- **Conclusion** is relatively short for top-journal standards and reads more like an extended abstract + policy suggestions than a full conclusion section with interpretation, limitations, external validity, and next steps in paragraph form.

### 5) **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not empty/broken)**  
**PASS.** The included figures (event study plot; triple-difference decomposition) appear to display plotted series/points with axes and non-empty content.

### 6) **Tables (real numbers; no placeholders like TBD/XXX)**  
**PASS.** Tables shown (summary statistics; main regression; heterogeneity; adoption dates) contain numeric entries rather than placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Increase main-text length to ≥ 25 pages** (excluding references/appendix). This typically requires: deeper literature review, richer institutional background, expanded identification threats, fuller robustness section, and more thorough discussion/external validity.
2. **Expand bibliography to ≥ 15 references.**
3. **Replace bullet points/numbered lists with paragraph prose** in the Introduction, Background/Literature, Results narration, and Discussion/Limitations (you can keep occasional in-text enumerations, but not list-form presentation).
4. **Ensure each major section (Intro, Literature/Background, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion) contains 3–4 substantive paragraphs** of continuous prose (not just short subsections and lists).

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until Phase 1 passes.
