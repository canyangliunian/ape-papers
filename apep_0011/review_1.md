## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1) **Length (≥25 pages excl. refs/appendix): FAIL**  
- Approximate pagination: main text runs roughly pp. 3–17 (≈15 pages). Even including title/abstract pages, the manuscript is well under 25 pages.

2) **References (≥15 citations in bibliography): FAIL**  
- Bibliography lists **7** references (Callaway & Sant’Anna; Dee et al.; Morisi; Neumark & Wascher; Ruhm; Shope; Williams & Shults), far below 15.

3) **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): FAIL**  
- Multiple sections rely on bullet points/numbered lists rather than paragraph prose, including:
  - **Introduction** (uses enumerated “Several features…” list later; also uses list-style exposition)
  - **Background** (explicit numbered lists of restrictions; occupation lists)
  - **Data** (bulleted variable lists)
  - **Results/Discussion** (numbered lists and bullet-style limitations)

4) **Section Completeness (≥3–4 substantive paragraphs each major section): FAIL**  
- Several major sections are too thin and/or structured as lists rather than substantive multi-paragraph development. In particular:
  - **Data (Section 3)**: largely schematic (source/variable bullets; brief sample construction; brief summary stats discussion).
  - **Conclusion (Section 7)**: relatively short for a top-journal paper and does not provide a full synthesis, limitations, external validity, and policy counterfactual discussion at sufficient depth.
  - **Literature positioning** is not a dedicated, developed section (and the reference list is very short), which typically coincides with insufficient paragraph-level engagement.

5) **Figures (visible data, not broken): PASS**  
- The event-study figure and the DDD decomposition figure appear to contain plotted series/points with axes and confidence bands; they are not empty/broken.

6) **Tables (real numbers, not placeholders): PASS**  
- Tables display numeric estimates, standard errors, and summary statistics; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders are visible.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1) **Increase manuscript length to ≥25 pages (excluding references/appendix)** by expanding core sections (especially literature, data construction/measurement, identification threats, robustness/heterogeneity, and interpretation/welfare discussion).  
2) **Expand bibliography to ≥15 citations** with appropriate coverage of (i) GDL/safety, (ii) teen labor markets, (iii) DiD with staggered adoption/event studies, and (iv) transportation constraints and labor supply.  
3) **Convert bullet points/numbered lists into full paragraph prose** in Introduction, Background/Literature, Results, and Discussion (lists can remain sparingly in appendices).  
4) **Ensure each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs** (Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion), with coherent narrative development rather than outline-style presentation.

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until these format issues are addressed.
