## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excl. refs/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The main paper appears to run to about **12 pages** (page numbers shown through “12” for the conclusion), with references on p.13 and appendix starting p.14. This is well below 25 pages.

2. **References (≥15 citations in bibliography)**: **FAIL**  
   - The bibliography lists **~7 references** (Agan & Starr; Craigie; Doleac & Hansen; DuPuis et al.; Ruggles et al.; U.S. Census Bureau; plus one more if counting the IPUMS entry separately—still far below 15).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **FAIL**  
   - The paper uses **bulleted/outline-style lists** in the **Results** and **Discussion** (e.g., “The estimate is … (1)…(2)…(3)…” in §7.4; and colon-led list formatting in §8.1). The requirement explicitly disallows bullet-point style in these sections.

4. **Section Completeness (≥3–4 substantive paragraphs per major section)**: **FAIL**  
   - **Conclusion (§9)** is **~2 paragraphs** and reads brief relative to a full journal-style conclusion (no extended discussion of implications, external validity, or a roadmap for future research beyond a short list).  
   - Some other major sections rely heavily on short subsections rather than sustained paragraphs (e.g., Institutional Background/Conceptual Framework are largely list-structured), which contributes to the “sketch” feel.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; none broken/empty)**: **FAIL**  
   - The paper references **“Figure 1”** (§7.3) but **no figure is actually shown** in the provided manuscript; the event study is presented only as Table 3. As provided, the figure is effectively **missing**.

6. **Tables (real numbers; no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables 1–4 contain **actual numeric values** (no “TBD/XXX” placeholders).

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Must-fix issues before content review
- **Expand to ≥25 pages** of main text (excluding references/appendix). As-is (~12 pages), it is far too short for a journal-style empirical econ paper.
- **Expand bibliography to ≥15 references** and integrate them into the narrative (not just a longer list).
- **Replace bullet/outline formatting with paragraph prose** in **Results** and **Discussion** (and ideally throughout). Convert enumerated “(1)(2)(3)” lists into full paragraphs.
- **Ensure each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs**, especially the **Conclusion**, and strengthen the paper’s structure (motivation → identification → estimation → inference → robustness → mechanisms → implications).
- **Include the referenced figure(s)** (at minimum Figure 1) with clearly labeled axes, units, sample, and notes.

Per your instructions, I’m stopping here and **not proceeding to Phase 2** until these format problems are addressed.
