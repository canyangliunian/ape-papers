## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excl. references/appendix): FAIL**  
   - The document is **26 pages total**, but **References + Appendix occupy ~4 pages (pp. 23–26)**.  
   - That leaves **~22 pages of main text (pp. 1–22)**, which is **below 25 pages**.

2. **References (≥15 citations): PASS**  
   - Bibliography contains **~17 references** (Agan & Starr; Arrow; Autor et al.; Craigie; Doleac & Hansen; DuPuis et al.; Holzer et al.; Jackson & Zhao; Meer & West; Pager; Pager et al.; Phelps; Ruggles et al.; Shoag & Veuger; Uggen et al.; U.S. Census; Western).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet-point sections in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): PASS**  
   - Introduction, Related Literature, Results, and Discussion are written in continuous prose paragraphs (no bullet lists).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs): PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, and Conclusion each appear to have multiple substantive paragraphs/subsections (not 1–2 paragraph sketches).

5. **Figures (all figures show visible data): FAIL**  
   - **Figure 1 appears broken/empty in the provided rendering**: the axes and labels are visible, but the plotted series/points are not visibly rendered here. Even if this is a copy/paste artifact, **as submitted this fails the “visible data” requirement**.

6. **Tables (real numbers, no placeholders): PASS**  
   - Tables 1–3 contain numeric values and no “TBD/XXX” placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Main-text length is under 25 pages (excluding references/appendix).**  
   - Expand the core paper (e.g., stronger institutional detail, richer robustness/alternative specifications, clearer inference strategy with few clusters, additional outcomes like wages/hours, more diagnostics, mechanisms, or an Indianapolis-focused analysis).

2. **Figure 1 is not publication-usable as shown (visible data missing).**  
   - Re-export and embed the figure at journal quality (vector PDF/SVG preferred), ensuring the **data series/points and any confidence intervals are clearly visible**, axes are correctly scaled, and labeling is readable in print.

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until these format issues are corrected.
