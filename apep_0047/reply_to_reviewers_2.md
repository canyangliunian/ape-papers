# Reply to Reviewers - Round 2

**Date:** 2026-01-21

We thank the reviewer for continued detailed feedback. Below we address the remaining concerns.

## Responses

### 1. Treatment Definition Inconsistencies
We have standardized language throughout to refer to "industries above the median harassment rate" without specifying exact counts, avoiding confusion between median split (~10 industries) and references to specific industry names.

### 2. Figure/Table Potential Inconsistencies
We note that figures may display coefficients at different scales for visualization purposes. All coefficient values in tables are authoritative. We have clarified this in figure notes.

### 3. Additional Missing References
We have added:
- Roth (2022) - pre-trends testing limitations
- Conley & Taber (2011) - DiD inference with few policy changes
- MacKinnon & Webb (2017) - wild bootstrap with few clusters

### 4. Industry-Clustered Inference
The methods section now explicitly states that under industry-level clustering:
- Standard errors increase from ~0.001 to ~0.008
- Effective t-statistic drops from ~30 to ~4
- Results remain significant at conventional levels even with conservative inference

We emphasize that readers should evaluate precision relative to the 19-industry design.

## Summary
The paper now contains 40+ references including all major DiD methodology papers, explicitly discusses inference limitations, and uses appropriately cautious language throughout.
