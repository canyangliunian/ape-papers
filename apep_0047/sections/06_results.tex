\section{Results}

This section presents our main findings on the effect of \#MeToo on female employment in high-harassment industries.

\subsection{Main Triple-Difference Estimates}

Table \ref{tab:main_results} presents our main triple-difference estimates. Column 1 shows our baseline specification with state, industry, and quarter fixed effects. The triple-difference coefficient is 0.577, indicating that female employment in high-harassment industries increased relative to the counterfactual. However, this specification does not adequately control for differential trends.

Columns 2-4 progressively add more demanding fixed effects. Column 2 adds state $\times$ quarter fixed effects to absorb time-varying state factors. Column 3 adds industry $\times$ quarter fixed effects to absorb industry-specific trends. Column 4 presents our preferred specification with the full set of fixed effects: state $\times$ quarter, industry $\times$ gender, gender $\times$ quarter, and industry $\times$ quarter.

\input{figures/table2_ddd_results}

In our preferred specification (Column 4), the triple-difference coefficient is $-0.034$ with a standard error of 0.001, yielding a $t$-statistic of $-30.0$. Since our dependent variable is log employment, this coefficient represents a 3.4 log point decline, which approximates a 3.4 percentage point reduction in female employment in high-harassment industries relative to male employment in the same industries and relative to female employment in low-harassment industries.\footnote{For small changes, the log approximation $\ln(1+x) \approx x$ holds for $|x| \ll 1$. Thus a coefficient of $-0.034$ implies approximately a 3.4 percent change.}

To interpret the magnitude, consider that the average high-harassment industry in our sample employs approximately 100,000 women per state-quarter. A 3.4 percent reduction corresponds to 3,400 fewer female workers per state-quarter. However, readers should interpret both the magnitude and precision of this estimate with appropriate caution. With treatment varying across only 19 industries, standard errors under industry-level clustering are substantially larger than under state-industry clustering. Moreover, this reduced-form estimate captures relative employment changes; it does not identify whether displaced women exited the labor force, moved to other industries, or experienced other outcomes. The back-of-envelope extrapolation to national employment effects ignores general equilibrium reallocation.

\subsection{Event Study Estimates}

Figure \ref{fig:event_study} displays event study estimates from equation \eqref{eq:event_study}. The figure plots triple-difference coefficients for each quarter from Q1 2014 through Q4 2023, with Q3 2017 (the quarter immediately before \#MeToo) as the omitted reference period.

    \caption*{\footnotesize Note: Figure displays triple-difference coefficients from equation \eqref{eq:event_study}. The reference period is Q3 2017 (one quarter before \#MeToo).

\end{figure}

Two features of the event study are notable. First, the pre-period coefficients are small and statistically indistinguishable from zero, supporting the parallel trends assumption. A formal test of joint significance of the 12 pre-treatment coefficients yields an $F$-statistic of 0.94 ($p = 0.51$), failing to reject the null of no pre-trends.

Second, the treatment effect emerges immediately in Q4 2017 and remains stable thereafter. The post-treatment coefficients range from $-0.03$ to $-0.04$, consistent with a permanent shift in female employment rather than a temporary response to media attention. There is no evidence of anticipation effects in Q2 or Q3 2017, and no evidence that the effect dissipated over time.

\subsection{Trends by Group}

Figure \ref{fig:trends} displays raw employment trends by group (female/male $\times$ high/low harassment) indexed to Q1 2014. The figure reveals that female employment in high-harassment industries was growing at a similar rate to other groups prior to October 2017 but experienced a relative decline thereafter.

    \caption*{\footnotesize Note: Employment indexed to Q1 2014 = 100. High-harassment industries include accommodation and food services, retail trade, healthcare, arts and entertainment, and administrative services. Vertical dashed line indicates October 2017 (\#MeToo).}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Industry-Specific Effects}

Our triple-difference design pools across high-harassment industries. To examine heterogeneity, we estimate separate difference-in-differences models for each industry, comparing female to male employment before and after October 2017.

Figure \ref{fig:industry_effects} displays these industry-specific coefficients alongside the industry harassment rate. The largest negative effects appear in the highest-harassment industries: accommodation and food services ($-0.030$), retail trade ($-0.029$), and healthcare ($-0.066$). Low-harassment industries like finance, professional services, and information show near-zero or slightly positive effects.

    \caption*{\footnotesize Note: Each bar shows the coefficient on Female $\times$ Post-MeToo from a difference-in-differences regression within the specified industry. Error bars show 95\% confidence intervals with state-clustered standard errors.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dose-Response Relationship}

Figure \ref{fig:dose_response} examines whether the treatment effect varies with harassment intensity by plotting industry-specific effects against harassment rates. The relationship is strongly negative: industries with higher harassment rates experienced larger declines in female employment after \#MeToo. A linear regression of industry effects on log harassment rates yields a slope of $-0.015$ ($p < 0.01$), indicating that a 10 percent higher harassment rate is associated with a 0.15 percentage point larger effect on female employment.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/figure6_dose_response.png}
    \caption{Dose-Response: Female Employment Effect by Harassment Exposure}
    \label{fig:dose_response}
    \caption*{\footnotesize Note: Each point represents an industry. The horizontal axis shows the industry's harassment charge rate (per 10,000 employees). The vertical axis shows the industry-specific female employment effect. The line shows a linear fit.}
\end{figure}

This dose-response relationship provides additional support for our interpretation. If the observed effects were driven by confounding factors unrelated to harassment, we would not expect a systematic relationship between harassment exposure and employment changes. The gradient suggests that male avoidance behavior is indeed concentrated in industries where perceived liability risk is highest.
