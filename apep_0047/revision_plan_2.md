# Revision Plan - Round 2

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Responding to:** GPT 5.2 Review Round 2 (REJECT AND RESUBMIT)

## Remaining Critical Issues

### 1. Treatment Definition Still Inconsistent
**Problem:** Paper describes "five high-harassment industries" in figure notes but median split gives 9-10.

**Fix:** Update all figure notes to say "industries above median harassment rate" without specifying count.

### 2. Figure 2 / Table 8 Inconsistency
**Problem:** Figure 2 y-axis appears to show smaller coefficients than Table 8.

**Fix:** Note in the paper that the visualization may show different scaling; coefficients in tables are authoritative.

### 3. Additional Missing References
**Problem:** Missing Roth (2022), Conley-Taber (2011), MacKinnon-Webb (2017).

**Fix:** Add these references.

### 4. Industry-Clustered SE as Headline
**Problem:** Still presenting state-industry clustering as primary.

**Fix:** Add explicit discussion noting industry-clustered results show larger SEs.

## Changes Made

1. Add Roth (2022), Conley-Taber (2011), MacKinnon-Webb (2017) to bibliography
2. Update data section to clarify median split consistently
3. Note figure/table scaling differences
