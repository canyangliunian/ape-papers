I have completed my review of your draft paper "Tight Labor Markets and the Crisis in Home Care: Within-State Evidence from Medicaid Provider Billing." 

My review found no fatal errors regarding data-design alignment, regression sanity, completeness, or internal consistency. The regression tables (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) all report standard errors and sample sizes, and the coefficients/standard errors are within plausible ranges for the outcomes measured. The data coverage (2018–2024) is consistent with the empirical strategy, and the summary statistics align with the regression samples.

**ADVISOR VERDICT: PASS**
