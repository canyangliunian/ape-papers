# Research Ideas (Revision of apep_0202)

## Idea 1: Social Network Connections and Local Labor Market Outcomes (REVISION)

**Policy:** State minimum wage increases, 2012-2022
**Outcome:** County-level employment and earnings from Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)
**Identification:** Shift-share IV using out-of-state population-weighted SCI exposure
**Why it's novel:** Population-weighted SCI exposure captures the scale of network connections to high-wage areas, not just network share
**Feasibility check:** Confirmed: variation exists across 3,100+ counties, data accessible via Census QWI API, identification leverages Facebook SCI

This is a revision of apep_0202 addressing code integrity issues, reframing from "information volume" to core economics, dropping event study, and restructuring to 35-40 page main text with proper appendix.
