## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excl. refs/appx)**: **FAIL**  
   - The manuscript as provided runs to **~11 pages** (page numbers shown 1–11). This is well under 20 pages.

2. **References (≥15 citations in bibliography)**: **FAIL**  
   - Bibliography contains **3 references** (Callaway & Sant’Anna 2021; Pichler & Ziebarth 2020; Stearns et al. 2025), far below 15 (and below 10).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in major sections)**: **FAIL**  
   - Bullet-point formatting appears in key sections, e.g. **Data and Methodology** (“Sample construction:” bullets) and **Robustness** (bulleted list). This violates the “complete paragraphs (not bullet points)” requirement for major sections.

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **FAIL**  
   - Several major sections are too short / not developed to 3–4 substantive paragraphs (e.g., **Conclusion** is ~1 paragraph; **Data** and **Methodology** are brief and partly bullets; **Results** subsections are short). As written, the paper reads like an extended summary rather than a full article.

5. **Figures (visible data; not broken)**: **FAIL**  
   - Figure 1 is rendered as **ASCII art** with asterisks and an informal note (“--- = 95% CI contains zero”), not a publication-quality figure with clearly defined axes, units, and confidence intervals. This is not an acceptable “visible data” figure for an academic submission.

6. **Tables (real numbers, no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables 1–3 contain numeric entries and do not show “TBD/XXX” placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
- Expand the manuscript to **≥25 pages** (excluding references/appendix).  
- Expand the bibliography to **≥15 credible, field-relevant citations** (at minimum; typical econ papers cite far more).  
- Replace bullet lists in major sections with **fully developed prose** (you can keep bullets in an appendix if absolutely necessary, but not in the main narrative under your rules).  
- Ensure **each major section** (Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion) has **3–4 substantive paragraphs** with sufficient detail.  
- Replace the ASCII event-study graphic with a **real figure** (proper plotting, labeled axes, units, confidence intervals, readable legend/caption, and publication-quality formatting).  

Per your instructions, I will **not proceed to Phase 2 (content review)** until these format problems are corrected.
