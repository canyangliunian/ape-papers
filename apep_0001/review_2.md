**Paper:** paper.pdf
**Reasoning effort:** high

## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The PDF page numbers run to ~25 total pages, but **references begin around p. 23** and run through p. 25. That implies the main text is **~22 pages** (pp. 1–22), which is **below 25 pages excluding references**.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
   - Bibliography contains **15** entries (Baum & Ruhm; Bertrand et al.; BLS; Callaway & Sant’Anna; DeAnglis et al.; National Partnership; Goetzel et al.; Goodman-Bacon; Gruber; Miller & Wherry; Norton et al.; Pichler & Ziebarth; Stearns et al.; Summers; Sun & Abraham).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in major sections)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature Review, Results, and Discussion are written in paragraphs (no bulleted formatting detected).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, and Conclusion each contain multiple substantive paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not broken/empty)**: **PASS**  
   - Figure 1 shows plotted coefficients with confidence intervals and labeled axes; it does not appear empty/broken.

6. **Tables (all tables contain real numbers, no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables 1–5 report numeric values (no “TBD/XXX” placeholders).

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
- **Insufficient length**: The main paper appears to be **~22 pages excluding references**, which **fails** the requirement of **≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix**.  
  - To fix: expand the main text by ~3+ pages (e.g., fuller institutional/policy variation discussion; deeper identification threats and diagnostics; additional robustness/alternative samples; more detailed data construction; additional figures/tables or appendix moved into main text if journal-appropriate).

Per your instructions, I’m **not proceeding to Phase 2** until the length requirement is met.
