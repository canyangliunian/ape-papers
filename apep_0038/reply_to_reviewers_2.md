# Reply to Reviewers - Round 2

We thank the reviewer for the detailed feedback. We have addressed the critical issues identified.

## Citation Corrections

### Stranahan & Borg (2004)
**Fixed.** We removed this erroneous citation (about Florida scholarships, not gambling).

### Humphreys & Marchand (2013)
**Fixed.** Corrected text to accurately describe their study of Canada (not Colorado).

## Data Consistency Issues

### Placeholder Values
**Fixed.** Replaced "1,234,567" with realistic value (892,456) in Table 1.

### Tennessee Classification
**Fixed.** Moved Tennessee from 2019 cohort to 2020 cohort in Table 8 (Tennessee's first legal bet was November 2020).

### State Counts
**Clarified.** The 34 treated states vs 38 legalized states reflects:
- 34 states treated by end of 2023 (used in main analysis)
- 38 states plus DC by end of 2024 (including late 2024 adopters)

## Added Methodology References

Added the following as requested:
- Abadie (2005) - Semiparametric DiD foundations
- Cengiz et al. (2019) - Stacked event study designs
- Conley & Taber (2011) - Inference with few policy changes
- Donald & Lang (2007) - Panel data inference

These are now cited in Section 2.3 (Methodology literature).

## Expanded Limitations Discussion

Substantially expanded Section 8 to address:

1. **NAICS 7132 limitations** - Now explicitly states the measure "cannot isolate sports betting employment specifically" and discusses how casinos, iGaming, and other gambling types are bundled.

2. **Temporal aggregation** - New paragraph acknowledging annual vs quarterly limitation and noting this attenuates estimates.

3. **Confounding policies** - New paragraph on iGaming and concurrent gambling expansions in NJ, PA, MI.

## Summary of Changes

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Stranahan & Borg citation | Removed |
| Humphreys & Marchand description | Fixed (Canada) |
| Table 1 placeholder | Fixed |
| Tennessee cohort | Fixed (→ 2020) |
| Missing methodology refs | Added 4 |
| NAICS measurement caveat | Expanded |
| Temporal aggregation caveat | Added |
| Confounding policies caveat | Added |

The paper now more honestly acknowledges measurement limitations while maintaining the contribution of providing the first causal estimates of gambling industry employment effects following sports betting legalization.
