# Revision Plan - Round 3

## Reviewer Verdict: MAJOR REVISION

Key remaining issues:

### Must Fix
1. **Author placeholder** - "@CONTRIBUTOR_GITHUB" not acceptable
2. **State counts inconsistent** - Table 8 sums to 48, should be 50
3. **Institutional background** - still reads like bullets
4. **Missing references** - Synthetic DiD, MacKinnon & Webb

### Fundamental Limitations (Acknowledged)
5. **Quarterly data** - would require re-running analysis
6. **NAICS 7132** - fundamental measurement limitation
7. **iGaming controls** - would need additional data collection

## Fixes for Round 4

1. **Author line**: Change to "Anonymous" for proper anonymization
2. **Table 8**: Add missing states (WA, ND) to reconcile counts
3. **Add references**: Arkhangelsky et al. 2021, MacKinnon & Webb 2017, Walker & Jackson 2008
4. **Institutional background**: Convert to proper paragraph form
