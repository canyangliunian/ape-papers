## Idea 1: Employment Effects of Sports Betting Legalization (Revision of APEP-0038)

**Policy:** Sports betting legalization following Murphy v. NCAA (2018), staggered across 34 states by 2024
**Outcome:** NAICS 7132 (Gambling Industries) employment from BLS QCEW
**Identification:** Callaway-Sant'Anna DiD exploiting staggered state adoption
**Why it's novel:** First rigorous causal estimates; revision fixes data integrity issues
**Feasibility check:** Confirmed: 34 treated states, 15 never-treated, real BLS data accessible via API

This is a revision of the parent paper (apep_0038) focused on fixing code integrity issues and adding reviewer-requested analyses (wages, spillovers).
