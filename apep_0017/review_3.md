## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1) **Length (≥25 pages excl. refs/appendix)**: **PASS**  
- From the table of contents: Introduction starts p.4 and Conclusion is p.35, with References starting p.36. That implies ~32 pages of main text (4–35), excluding references/appendix.

2) **References (≥15 citations)**: **PASS**  
- Bibliography lists ~25–30 references (well above 15).

3) **Prose Quality (no bullet points in major sections)**: **PASS**  
- Introduction, Literature Review, Results, and Discussion are written in paragraph prose (no bullet-point structure observed).

4) **Section Completeness (≥3–4 substantive paragraphs each)**: **PASS**  
- Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods/Identification, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion all appear to contain multiple substantive paragraphs.

5) **Figures (all figures show visible data; not empty/broken)**: **FAIL**  
- Figures are referenced (e.g., “Figure 1”, “Figure 2”, etc.) but **no figure images are provided in the version I received**, so I cannot verify that they contain visible data, correct axes, or are not broken/empty.

6) **Tables (all tables contain real numbers; no placeholders)**: **FAIL**  
- Some numeric tables appear (e.g., the FPL guideline table in Appendix A.2), but the main results tables (Tables 1–5) are referenced and **not actually shown** here. I therefore cannot verify that *all* tables contain real numbers (and not placeholders like “TBD/XXX”) in the submitted version.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1) **Include all figures (Figure 1–Figure 4, etc.) in the manuscript/PDF** with:
   - visible plotted data,
   - labeled axes and units,
   - readable notes/captions stating sample, bandwidth, kernel, and specification.

2) **Include all main tables (Tables 1–5, etc.) in the manuscript/PDF** (not just referenced in-text), ensuring:
   - all entries are actual numbers (no placeholders),
   - table titles/captions clearly define outcomes, bandwidths, and samples.

Once the complete paper with figures and tables is provided, I can proceed to **Phase 2 (content + econometric rigor review)**.
