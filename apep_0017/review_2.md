## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excl. refs/appendix)**: **PASS**  
   - The manuscript shows page numbers through at least p.35 for the conclusion, with references starting around p.36 and appendix around p.40. Main text appears ≥35 pages.

2. **References (≥15 citations)**: **PASS**  
   - Bibliography lists ~25–30+ distinct entries (well above 15).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet-point sections)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature Review, Results, and Discussion are written in paragraph prose (no bullet-point formatting observed in the provided text).

4. **Section Completeness (≥3–4 substantive paragraphs each)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature, Data, Identification/Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion each contain multiple substantive paragraphs in the provided text.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not broken/empty)**: **FAIL**  
   - The text references Figures 1–4, but the figures themselves are not provided here. I cannot verify whether they display visible data, correct axes, or are non-broken.

6. **Tables (all tables contain real numbers; no placeholders)**: **FAIL**  
   - While the appendix poverty-guidelines table shows real numbers, the main empirical tables (Tables 1–5; e.g., first stage, reduced form, placebo tests, heterogeneity) are referenced but not shown. I cannot verify they contain real numbers (and no placeholders like “TBD/XXX”) or that they report required regression outputs.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before Phase 2 (content) review:
1. **Provide all figures (Figures 1–4) exactly as in the paper** so I can verify they are non-empty, correctly labeled, and show actual data with sensible axes/scales.
2. **Provide all main tables (Tables 1–5, plus any appendix tables used for estimation/results)** so I can verify:
   - they contain real numeric entries (no placeholders),
   - and (for Phase 2) they report core regression outputs (coefficients with SEs, N, bandwidths, etc.).

Once you paste or upload the missing figures and tables (or the full PDF), I can proceed to **Phase 2: Content Review** under top-journal standards.
