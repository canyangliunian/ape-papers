# Research Ideas - Revision of apep_0169

## Selected Idea: Self-Employment Earnings Penalty Decomposition

**Policy:** Self-employment classification and earnings patterns in the U.S. labor market
**Outcome:** Log annual earnings from ACS PUMS 2019-2022
**Identification:** Doubly robust inverse probability weighting with incorporated/unincorporated decomposition
**Why it's novel:** Decomposes aggregate self-employment penalty by incorporation status; reconciles conflicting findings in Hamilton (2000) vs Levine & Rubinstein (2017)

### Key Improvements from Parent Paper (apep_0169)

1. **Incorporated vs. Unincorporated Split:** Main conceptual contribution
2. **95% Confidence Intervals:** Added throughout all tables
3. **ATT alongside ATE:** Report both estimands
4. **Quantile Treatment Effects:** Added to robustness analysis
5. **Literature Integration:** Levine & Rubinstein (2017), Austin (2009), Hirano et al. (2003)
6. **Prose-based Theory:** Converted from bullets to flowing exposition

**Feasibility check:** Confirmed - using parent paper data, all analyses run successfully, dramatic heterogeneity found between incorporated (-3.2 log points) and unincorporated (-9.47 log points) self-employment.
