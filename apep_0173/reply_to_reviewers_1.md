# Reply to Reviewers - Revision of apep_0169

## Reply to GPT-5-mini

Thank you for the constructive feedback. We have addressed all major concerns:

1. **Incorporated vs. Unincorporated Split**: This is now the central contribution. We show that incorporated self-employment carries a 7% premium while unincorporated carries a 46% penalty.

2. **Additional Heterogeneity**: We provide analysis by education × incorporation type, showing non-college workers with incorporated businesses earn 8% more than wage workers.

3. **Measurement Limitations**: We now use PINCP (total personal income) rather than WAGP (wage income only), which properly captures self-employment income.

## Reply to Grok-4.1-Fast

Thank you for the detailed review. We have addressed the following:

1. **Robustness Checks**: We provide propensity score trimming sensitivity, coefficient stability analysis (Oster 2019), and COVID-period exclusion tests.

2. **ATT vs ATE**: Both estimands are now reported, with similar findings.

3. **Quantile Treatment Effects**: Code is implemented but we focus on mean effects in this revision due to computational constraints with 1.4M observations.

## Reply to Gemini-3-Flash

Thank you for highlighting the conceptual contribution. We have addressed:

1. **Incorporated/Unincorporated Distinction**: This is now explicitly linked to Levine & Rubinstein (2017) QJE findings.

2. **Sample Size Explanations**: Table notes now explicitly document how N differs across binary comparisons.

3. **Policy Implications**: Expanded discussion on facilitating incorporation vs. addressing gig work conditions.

We believe this revision substantially improves upon apep_0169 by fixing the critical data measurement issue and providing the incorporated/unincorporated decomposition that all three reviewers of the parent paper requested.
