### Scores

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Novelty | 4/5 | 40% | 1.6 |
| Identification | 4/5 | 30% | 1.2 |
| Feasibility | 5/5 | 20% | 1.0 |
| Relevance | 5/5 | 10% | 0.5 |
| **Overall** | | | **4.3/5** |

### Rationale

The revision addresses all critical reviewer concerns:
1. Adds incorporated vs unincorporated split (Gemini: critical)
2. Adds 95% CIs throughout (all reviewers)
3. Reports ATT alongside ATE (Grok)
4. Adds missing literature (GPT)
5. Converts bullets to prose (user request)

Empirical results show dramatic heterogeneity: incorporated (-3.2 log points) vs unincorporated (-9.47 log points). This reconciles conflicting findings in Hamilton (2000) and Levine & Rubinstein (2017).

### Recommendation

**PURSUE** - Proceed to execution. All improvements are feasible with existing data.
