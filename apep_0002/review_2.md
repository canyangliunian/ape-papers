## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The manuscript appears to run **~23 pages total including the references** (page numbers shown up to 23). That implies the **main text is well under 25 pages**, and certainly **not ≥25 pages excluding references/appendix**.

2. **References (≥15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
   - Bibliography lists **~16 references** (Ahn; Aiken; AHA; Bae; Buerhaus; Callaway; Dall; Goodman-Bacon; IOM; Kleiner & Krueger; McGillis Hall et al.; Propper & Van Reenen; Rogers; Shields & Ward; Thornton & Timmons; Trinkoff et al.).

3. **Prose Quality (complete paragraphs; no bullet-point sections)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature Review, Results, and Discussion are written in paragraph form (no bullet formatting observed).

4. **Section Completeness (≥3–4 substantive paragraphs per major section)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature Review, Data, Empirical Strategy, Results, and Conclusion each contain multiple substantive paragraphs.

5. **Figures (must contain visible data; not broken/empty)**: **PASS**  
   - Figure 1 (event-study plot) displays year markers and coefficients/CI depiction; it does not appear empty or obviously broken in the provided rendering.

6. **Tables (must contain real numbers, not placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables report numeric means/estimates/SEs/t-stats; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Issues that must be fixed before content review
- **Length requirement not met**: The paper appears to be **~23 pages total including references**, which is **below the minimum 25 pages excluding references/appendix**.  
  - To pass, expand the **main text** (not the bibliography) to at least **25 pages excluding references/appendix**—typically by adding substantive content (e.g., robustness/alternative specifications, additional outcomes, institutional detail, diagnostics, sensitivity analyses, supplemental figures/tables, deeper discussion of mechanisms and enforcement, and/or an appendix with additional analyses—though note appendices don’t count toward the ≥25 pages under your rule).

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until the format issue is resolved.
