## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages, excl. refs/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The manuscript appears to be ~12 pages total (page numbers shown run 1–12, with references on p. 11–12). This is well under 20 pages.

2. **References (≥15 bibliography entries)**: **FAIL**  
   - The bibliography lists **8** references (Bae et al.; Callaway & Sant’Anna; Goodman-Bacon; IOM; Rogers et al.; Trinkoff et al.; AHA). This is below the 15-citation minimum.

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in major sections)**: **FAIL**  
   - The paper uses bullet points extensively in major sections, including:
     - **Institutional Background** (e.g., SB 476 provisions listed as bullets)
     - **Data / Sample Definition** (eligibility criteria as bullets)
     - **Variables** section uses a table (fine) but also bullet structure elsewhere
   - Requirement is “complete paragraphs (not bullet points)” for **Introduction, Literature Review, Results, Discussion**. While Introduction/Results/Discussion are mostly prose, the document as written relies heavily on bullets for core exposition and appears not to meet the stated standard for a journal-style manuscript (and it also lacks a real Literature Review section—see item 4).

4. **Section Completeness (≥3–4 substantive paragraphs each)**: **FAIL**  
   - Several major sections do not meet the “3–4 substantive paragraphs” standard:
     - **Literature Review**: effectively **missing** as a dedicated section; literature is mentioned briefly but not developed.
     - **Data**: largely schematic (definitions/tables/bullets) and short on substantive narrative discussion.
     - **Methods/Empirical Strategy**: present but quite compact; key components (standard errors, clustering level, specification variants) are not discussed in sufficient paragraph form.
     - **Conclusion**: short relative to the requirement (reads like ~2–3 brief paragraphs).

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not broken/empty)**: **FAIL**  
   - **Figure 1** is presented as a placeholder-like rendering (year labels, axes, dashed “Policy” marker), but the manuscript excerpt does not clearly show an actual plotted series with confidence intervals or points/lines. As provided, it is not verifiable as “visible data” and looks potentially broken/non-publication quality.

6. **Tables (real numbers; no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables shown (sample sizes, DiD hours, employment, heterogeneity) contain concrete numeric values and no “TBD/XXX” placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Expand the manuscript to ≥25 pages** (excluding references/appendix). As is, it’s ~12 pages and would be desk-rejected on length in many economics outlets.
2. **Expand the bibliography to ≥15 references** and integrate them meaningfully in-text (not just adding citations). Currently only ~8 references are listed.
3. **Replace bullet lists with paragraph-form prose** in core narrative sections (especially Institutional Background and Data), consistent with journal article conventions and your review rubric.
4. **Add a real Literature Review section** (and ensure each major section—Intro, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion—has **3–4 substantive paragraphs**).
5. **Fix/upgrade Figure 1** so it clearly displays data (point estimates) and uncertainty (standard errors/confidence intervals), with readable labels and a caption sufficient to stand alone.

Per your instructions, I will **not proceed to Phase 2** until these format requirements are met.
