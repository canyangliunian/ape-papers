\textit{Notes:} All specifications use the Callaway-Sant'Anna doubly-robust estimator with never-treated states as the control group, except where noted. ``Drop [Region]'' excludes all states in the specified Census region. ``Full-year exposure'' redefines treatment onset as the first full calendar year after ban adoption. ``Not-yet-treated controls'' uses states that have not yet adopted as the comparison group instead of never-treated states. ``Drop 2016 cohort (California)'' excludes California, whose first post-treatment observation is 2021 due to missing 2017--2020 data (see \Cref{sec:data_gaps}). ``Some-days smoking rate'' decomposes current smoking into everyday and some-days components; a negative effect on some-days smoking supports the compositional reclassification hypothesis for the everyday smoking result. Randomization inference $p$-value based on 1{,}000 permutations of treatment assignment. $^{***}p<0.01$, $^{**}p<0.05$, $^{*}p<0.10$.
