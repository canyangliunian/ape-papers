\textit{Notes:} Panel A reports doubly-robust difference-in-differences estimates following \citet{callaway2021difference}. The ATT is the average treatment effect on the treated, aggregated across all group-time cells. Panel B reports standard two-way fixed effects estimates with state and year fixed effects for comparison. Standard errors clustered at the state level in parentheses. $^{***}p<0.01$, $^{**}p<0.05$, $^{*}p<0.10$. Current smoking rate is the share of adults who currently smoke every day or some days. Quit attempts are measured among ever-smokers (smoked 100+ lifetime cigarettes) as having stopped smoking for one day or longer in the past 12 months because they were trying to quit. Source: BRFSS 1996--2004, 2006--2016, 2021--2022 (22 survey years; approximately 7.5 million individual observations aggregated to state-year means).
