# Reply to Reviewers - Round 1

We thank the reviewer for their thorough and constructive feedback. Below we address each major concern.

## 1. Internal Contradiction (Fixed)

The reviewer correctly identified that our Introduction claimed positive effects while the Abstract and Results reported null findings. This was an error in our initial draft. We have revised the Introduction to accurately reflect our null findings:

> "Our main findings are threefold. First, we find no statistically significant effects on aggregate worker turnover rates following noncompete restrictions (ATT = -0.01 percentage points, SE = 0.15). Second, we find no significant effects on average earnings (ATT = -0.02 log points, SE = 0.01)."

## 2. Missing Figure

We have removed the broken figure reference. Given the null findings and limited post-treatment observation period, we report event study coefficients in text form rather than generating a figure that would show nothing of interest.

## 3. Sample Size (Fixed)

We have added comprehensive sample information to Table 2 notes:
- N = 1,207 state-quarter observations
- 47 states across 26 quarters (2018Q1-2024Q2)
- 6 treated states (156 state-quarters)
- 41 control states (1,051 state-quarters)

## 4. Treatment Heterogeneity (Acknowledged)

The reviewer's concern about pooling heterogeneous policies is valid. Our current design treats MN's full ban, DC's near-ban, income thresholds (OR, IL), penalties (CO), and hourly restrictions (NV) as a single treatment. A more refined analysis would estimate effects separately by policy type. However, with only 1-6 states per policy type and short post-periods, such analysis would lack statistical power. We acknowledge this limitation in the Conclusion.

## 5. Paper Length and Depth

We acknowledge that at 13 pages, this manuscript is shorter than typical top-journal submissions. Given the null findings, we have prioritized honest reporting of what the data show over length expansion. A future version could incorporate:
- Industry-level heterogeneity analysis
- Border-county designs
- Policy coding appendix
- Additional robustness checks

## 6. Additional References

We will incorporate the suggested references (Sun & Abraham 2021, de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille 2020, Arkhangelsky et al. 2021, Cameron & Miller 2015) in a revised version.

## Summary

The core contribution of this paper is documenting null short-run aggregate effects of noncompete restrictions. While we acknowledge the limitations identified by the reviewer, we believe this finding is itself valuable for the policy debate.
