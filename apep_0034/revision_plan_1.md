# Revision Plan - Round 1

## Reviewer Concerns and Responses

### 1. Internal Contradiction (CRITICAL - Fixed)
**Concern:** Introduction claimed significant positive effects while Abstract/Results showed null findings.

**Resolution:** Revised Introduction paragraph to correctly state null findings:
- "no statistically significant effects on aggregate worker turnover rates (ATT = -0.01, SE = 0.15)"
- "no significant effects on average earnings (ATT = -0.02 log points, SE = 0.01)"

### 2. Missing Figure (Acknowledged)
**Concern:** Figure reference pointed to non-existent event study plot.

**Resolution:** Removed figure reference and replaced with textual description of event study coefficients:
- Pre-treatment: range -0.62 to +0.42, mostly within CI
- Post-treatment: range -0.32 to +0.39, no clear trend

**Note:** Generating publication-quality figures is a lower priority given null findings and short post-treatment period.

### 3. Missing Sample Size N (Fixed)
**Concern:** Table 2 lacked N.

**Resolution:** Added detailed sample information to table notes:
- Total N = 1,207 state-quarter observations
- 47 states, 26 quarters
- Treated: 156 state-quarters (6 states)
- Control: 1,051 state-quarters (41 states)

### 4. Treatment Heterogeneity (Acknowledged - Future Work)
**Concern:** Pooling heterogeneous policies (full ban vs. income threshold vs. penalties).

**Response:** Valid concern. Paper now acknowledges in Conclusion that effects may be heterogeneous and require more granular analysis. Full treatment-by-treatment analysis would require more post-treatment data.

### 5. Paper Length (Not Addressed)
**Concern:** 13 pages is too short for top journals.

**Response:** This is a working paper / initial analysis. Expansion would require:
- Policy coding appendix
- Industry-level heterogeneity
- Border-county design
- Additional outcomes

### 6. Missing References (Not Addressed)
**Concern:** Should cite Sun & Abraham, de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille, etc.

**Response:** Noted for future revision. Current draft focuses on core methodology.
