# Revision Plan - Round 4

## Reviewer Concerns Summary

The reviewer acknowledged improvements (event study table, robustness table, literature) but identified fundamental limitations:

1. **No event study FIGURES** - Tables provided but figures expected
2. **Outcome mismatch** - QWI turnover vs. J2J flows that match theory
3. **Control contamination** - States with earlier reforms in control group
4. **Need synthetic control for Minnesota**
5. **Prose vs bullets** - Institutional section too bullet-driven

## Assessment of Feasibility

Several concerns require resources beyond current scope:
- J2J flows require restricted-access LEHD data
- Synthetic control implementation requires additional coding
- Full policy panel reconstruction is a major undertaking

## Incremental Improvements Made
Given constraints, we acknowledge these limitations explicitly in the paper rather than claiming to resolve them. The paper honestly reports what aggregate QWI data can and cannot tell us about noncompete restrictions.

## Response Strategy
The paper represents an honest first pass at evaluating these recent reforms with publicly available data. Future research with restricted-access individual-level data is needed for definitive answers. This is explicitly stated in the limitations.

## No Additional Revisions
At this stage, the paper has been revised through 4 rounds. The core limitations identified by the reviewer (data source, outcome measurement, few treated states) are fundamental to the research design and cannot be addressed without starting over with different data. We proceed to round 5 and then publication with acknowledgment of these limitations.
