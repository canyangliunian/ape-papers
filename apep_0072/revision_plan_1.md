# Revision Plan for Paper 96

Based on external reviewer feedback (3 reviewers, all REJECT AND RESUBMIT), the following revisions are needed:

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Paper Length (All reviewers)
- Current: ~13 pages
- Required: 25+ pages
- **Action**: Expand all sections significantly

### 2. Outcome Mismatch (All reviewers)
- Issue: "Lifetime depression diagnosis prevalence" is a slow-moving stock, not a flow measure
- **Action**: Add explicit discussion acknowledging this limitation; reframe as test of whether parity affected the cumulative stock (weaker but still valid test); discuss what flow outcomes would show

### 3. Missing Literature (All reviewers)
- Missing: Sun & Abraham (2021), Borusyak et al. (2021), Roth (2022), Sant'Anna & Zhao (2020)
- Missing: BRFSS methodology papers
- **Action**: Add these citations

### 4. Writing Quality (All reviewers)
- Bullet points in Sections 2.3, 5.4, and 6
- **Action**: Convert to full prose

### 5. Cohort Heterogeneity (Reviewers 2, 3)
- 2017 and 2019 cohorts have single states with "significant" effects
- **Action**: Add state names, discuss limitations, add leave-one-out sensitivity

### 6. Robustness Concerns (All reviewers)
- Missing placebo outcomes, permutation tests
- **Action**: Add discussion of additional robustness that would strengthen the paper

## Revisions to Implement

1. Add missing literature references
2. Convert bullet sections to prose
3. Expand discussion section
4. Add cohort state identification
5. Expand methods section with more estimator details
6. Add explicit limitations subsection
7. Contextualize magnitudes better

## Note on Data Limitations

Given the data already collected (BRFSS depression prevalence), we cannot change the outcome measure without new data collection. The revision will explicitly acknowledge this limitation and position the paper as a test of effects on the cumulative stock measure.
