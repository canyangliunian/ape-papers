## Summary

This paper demonstrates doubly robust estimation methods using synthetic data calibrated to ACS characteristics. The methodology is sound for a demonstration paper, and the internal consistency issues identified in previous advisor reviews have been addressed.

## Key Strengths

1. Clear methodological exposition of AIPW/doubly robust estimation
2. Comprehensive robustness checks including sensitivity analysis
3. Appropriate acknowledgment of limitations (synthetic data, selection concerns)
4. Well-structured tables with proper inference (SEs, CIs)

## Areas for Improvement

1. The synthetic data limitation should be more prominently addressed in the abstract
2. Consider additional discussion of how results would differ with real data

## Decision

The paper passes internal review standards for a methodological demonstration.

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
