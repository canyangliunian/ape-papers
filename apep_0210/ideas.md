# Research Ideas

## This is a revision of apep_0133

This paper is a revision of apep_0133 (Swiss cantonal energy laws and federal referendum voting). The research question, identification strategy, and data sources are inherited from the parent paper.

## Idea 1: Does Local Climate Policy Build or Erode Support for National Action?

**Policy:** Swiss cantonal energy laws (MuKEn) adopted by 5 cantons between 2011-2017
**Outcome:** Federal Energy Strategy 2050 referendum vote shares (May 21, 2017) from BFS/swissdd
**Identification:** Spatial RDD at internal canton borders, same-language specification
**Why it's novel:** Tests thermostatic vs. positive feedback predictions for climate policy
**Feasibility check:** Confirmed — swissdd API provides Gemeinde-level results, BFS provides spatial boundaries, 5 treated cantons with staggered timing
