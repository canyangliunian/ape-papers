# Revision Plan: apep_0133 → Storytelling, Prose & Exhibits

## Context

Parent: apep_0133 (Swiss cantonal energy laws → federal referendum voting). Rating: 19.9 (σ=1.03), conservative 16.8. User directive: Focus on storytelling, prose, exhibits. Sharp abstract and intro are key. Conceptual points. NOT new econometrics.

## Workstreams

### 1. Sharp Abstract (~150 words)
Open with puzzle, state finding crisply, end with why it matters.

### 2. Rewrite Introduction (Hook + Arc)
New vivid opening hook. Finding in paragraph 2-3. Merge Contributions into flow. Delete Roadmap.

### 3. Conceptual Framework (Predictions)
Restructure Section 2 around competing hypotheses: H1 (positive feedback) vs H2 (thermostatic). Move inference discussion to Empirical Strategy.

### 4. Prose Polish (Shleifer Rules)
Active voice, cut filler, vary rhythm, story-driven results, forward-pulling transitions.

### 5. Exhibit Improvements
Consolidate 3 maps into 2-panel figure. Annotate RDD plots. Clean table formatting.

### 6. Fix DiDisc Treatment Coding
Replace simple `post` flag with canton-specific staggered timing.

### 7. Discussion + Conclusion
Lead with thermostatic interpretation. Memorable closing sentence.
