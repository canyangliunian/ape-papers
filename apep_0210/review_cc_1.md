# Internal Claude Code Review — Round 1

**Paper:** Does Local Climate Policy Build Demand for National Action? Evidence from Swiss Energy Referendums
**Revision of:** apep_0133

## Summary

This revision substantially improves the storytelling, prose quality, and exhibit presentation of the original paper. The core finding — that cantonal energy law exposure reduced support for federal energy legislation by ~5.9 pp at same-language borders — is now presented within a clean conceptual framework (H1: positive feedback vs. H2: thermostatic response) that gives the reader clear predictions before seeing results.

## Key Improvements Over Parent (apep_0133)

1. **Abstract:** Rewritten from 180+ words of throat-clearing to ~130 words with a hook-driven structure. Opens with the puzzle, states finding crisply, ends with the policy implication.

2. **Introduction:** New vivid opening hook ("On May 21, 2017, Swiss voters approved a sweeping national energy law..."). Finding stated by paragraph 5. Contributions woven into flow rather than a separate subsection. Roadmap subsection deleted.

3. **Conceptual Framework:** Section 2 restructured from encyclopedic lit review to a clean H1/H2 framework with bold predictions. "Inference with Few Clusters" moved to Empirical Strategy where it belongs.

4. **Prose quality:** Active voice throughout, shorter sentences for punch, story-driven results narration, forward-pulling transitions between sections.

5. **DiDisc treatment coding:** Fixed the SUSPICIOUS scan flag — replaced simple `post` flag with canton-specific staggered timing (GR 2011, BE 2012, AG 2013, BL 2016). Border-pair FE estimate now -4.65 pp (p=0.008).

6. **Border-dip interpretation:** New paragraph interpreting the treated-side dip near the border as evidence that the thermostatic effect operates through relative cost salience — strongest where cross-border comparison is visible.

7. **Discussion:** Restructured around "The Thermostat Wins" and "Why the Thermostat, Not Feedback?" with three reinforcing mechanisms.

8. **Conclusion:** Memorable closing line: "The thermostat works both ways."

## Remaining Concerns

1. **Some pre-existing R script failures:** Scripts 04 (robustness placebo), 06 (tables), and 08 (WCB) have pre-existing bugs. Key figures and tables are generated by scripts that succeed, but the failed scripts may leave some appendix exhibits stale.

2. **Internal consistency check needed:** The DiDisc table numbers in the paper should be verified against the CSV output from the corrected staggered coding.

3. **Page count:** 52 pages total (26 main text + appendix) — comfortably above the 25-page minimum.

## Verdict

The revision successfully addresses the user's core directive: improve storytelling, sharpen the abstract and intro, add conceptual structure, and fix the code integrity flag. The paper reads significantly better than the parent. Ready for external advisor and referee review.
