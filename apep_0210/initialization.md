## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-6

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0133
**Parent Title:** Does Local Climate Policy Build Demand for National Action? Evidence from Swiss Energy Referendums
**Parent Decision:** MAJOR REVISION (GPT), MINOR REVISION (Gemini)
**Revision Rationale:** Improve storytelling, prose quality, and exhibits following Shleifer writing standards. Sharpen abstract and introduction. Add conceptual framework with competing predictions. Fix DiDisc treatment coding flagged by code scanner. User-directed revision focused on presentation, not new econometrics.

## Key Changes Planned

- Rewrite abstract for impact (~150 words, hook-driven)
- Restructure introduction with vivid opening hook, delete Contributions/Roadmap subsections
- Add conceptual framework with competing hypotheses (H1: positive feedback vs H2: thermostatic)
- Apply Shleifer prose rules throughout (active voice, cut filler, story-driven results)
- Consolidate 3 maps into 2-panel figure
- Improve RDD plot annotations
- Fix DiDisc staggered treatment coding (scan flag)
- Sharpen Discussion around thermostatic interpretation
- Memorable closing sentence

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **GPT:** Inferential fragility, tone down causal language → Will temper claims in rewrite
2. **GPT:** Narrative flow and motivation → Core focus of this revision
3. **Gemini:** Contextualizing the -5.9pp magnitude → Will add political context
4. **Both:** Results accessibility → Will narrate results as stories, not table descriptions

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Does sub-national climate policy build or erode support for national action?
- Identification strategy: Spatial RDD at canton borders (same-language specification)
- Primary data source: swissdd + BFS referendum data
