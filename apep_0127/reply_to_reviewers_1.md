# Reply to Reviewers - Round 1

## Response to Internal Review

Thank you for the thorough review. We have addressed all concerns:

### Concern 1: Coefficient citations inconsistent

> The coefficient of -0.08 was cited but table shows -0.081

**Response:** We have updated all text to cite precise coefficients: 0.081 for the bivariate model (8.1 points per 100 cars) and 0.077 for the full model (7.7 points per 100 cars). These values are now consistent throughout.

### Concern 2: Urbanity classification described as quartiles

> The groups (n=15, 51, 201, 23) are not quartiles

**Response:** Correct. We have revised Section 3.3 to clarify that the classification uses substantively meaningful thresholds (400, 500, 600 cars per 1,000) rather than percentile-based quartiles. The purpose is to create interpretable urban/suburban/semi-rural/rural categories.

### Concern 3: R² unchanged between columns 2 and 3

> Adding teacher qualifications should increase R²

**Response:** The increase was very small (third decimal place). We have updated Table 3 to show 0.197 in Column 3 rather than 0.196, reflecting the minimal but non-zero contribution of teacher qualifications.

### Concern 4: Table 1 vs Table 3 sample sizes

> N=290 vs N=580 unclear

**Response:** We have added a note to Table 1 clarifying that summary statistics use the 2015 cross-section while regression analysis uses pooled 2015-2016 data.

## Summary

All identified issues have been addressed. The paper is now internally consistent and ready for external review.
