**Paper:** Car Ownership, Housing Tenure, and Educational Achievement: Urban-Rural Disparities in Swedish Municipalities

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-01

## Summary

This paper examines the relationship between car ownership patterns, housing tenure composition, and educational achievement across Swedish municipalities using administrative data from the Kolada database.

## Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. Clear research question and motivation
2. Comprehensive use of administrative data covering all 290 Swedish municipalities
3. Appropriate descriptive methodology given the cross-sectional data
4. Robust regression specifications with progressive controls
5. Well-structured presentation with 6 figures and 5 tables
6. Appropriate caveats about causal interpretation

**Areas for Improvement (addressed in revision):**
1. Clarified coefficient citations throughout the text
2. Fixed numerical consistency between abstract and tables
3. Corrected tercile statistics
4. Clarified urbanity classification is threshold-based, not quartile-based

## Verdict

The paper is methodologically sound and makes a clear contribution documenting the urban-rural educational gradient in Sweden. The findings that car ownership (as a proxy for urbanity) is negatively associated with educational achievement, and that housing tenure patterns correlate with outcomes, are well-documented.

**VERDICT: MINOR REVISION**

The paper requires minor consistency fixes but is otherwise ready for external review.
