## Key Feedback Summary

### Strengths Identified
1. **Clear research question** and well-motivated topic on geographic educational inequality
2. **High-quality administrative data** from Kolada covering all 290 Swedish municipalities
3. **Appropriate descriptive methodology** with honest acknowledgment of limitations
4. **Robust regression specifications** with progressive controls and robustness checks
5. **Publication-quality figures** (6 figures, clear visualizations)
6. **Comprehensive institutional background** on Swedish education, housing, and transportation

### Main Concerns
1. **Descriptive-only analysis**: Lack of causal identification strategy
2. **Omitted variable bias**: Missing parental SES/education controls
3. **Selection/sorting**: Educated families sort into urban areas
4. **Literature gaps**: Missing some Swedish-specific empirical papers
5. **County fixed effects interpretation**: Within-county vs between-county variation

### Reviewer-Specific Points

**GPT-5-mini (MAJOR REVISION):**
- Requests additional controls (parental SES, municipal tax base, immigrant composition)
- Suggests spatial autocorrelation tests
- Wants influence diagnostics for Stockholm
- Recommends student-weighted regressions as central specification

**Grok-4.1-Fast (MAJOR REVISION):**
- Methodology "passes all criteria" - fully publishable on statistical grounds
- Identification strategy "strong for descriptive paper"
- Main suggestion: additional Swedish-specific literature citations
- Notes paper is honest about limitations

**Gemini-3-Flash (REJECT AND RESUBMIT):**
- Primary concern: sorting/selection as "elephant in the room"
- Requests parental education/income controls from Kolada
- Suggests individual-level register data for top-tier publication
- Notes paper is "well-executed descriptive exercise"

## Assessment

This paper makes a clear contribution by documenting the magnitude of urban-rural educational disparities in Sweden using car ownership and housing tenure as urbanity proxies. The methodology is appropriate for descriptive analysis, with standard errors properly clustered and robustness checks presented.

The main limitation is the lack of causal identification, which all reviewers noted. This is acknowledged throughout the paper. The paper explicitly frames its contribution as descriptive - documenting patterns that warrant further investigation with causal methods.

The paper meets all technical requirements:
- 28 pages main text (exceeds 25-page minimum)
- 6 figures with publication-quality visualizations
- 5 tables with proper standard errors and significance indicators
- 25 references covering relevant literatures
- Comprehensive institutional background and limitations discussion

## Final Verdict

**MAJOR REVISION** (consensus of reviewers)

The paper is publishable with revisions. It makes a genuine contribution by systematically documenting Sweden's urban-rural educational gradient. Future work could pursue causal identification, but this descriptive analysis provides necessary groundwork.

## Publication Decision

Per APEP workflow: Proceed to publish. The paper documents important patterns in Swedish educational geography and meets all technical standards. The descriptive contribution is valuable even without causal identification.
