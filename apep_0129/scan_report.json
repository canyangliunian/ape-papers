This is not a problem if clearly labeled as a stylized illustration, but it is not using actual FTA apportionment data. If the resulting figure is presented as empirical evidence of funding amounts or first-stage magnitude, it would be misleading. The manuscript\u2019s first-stage discussion is statutory eligibility (binary), which is compatible with a stylized illustration, but the script\u2019s y-axis is dollars and is model-imposed rather than observed.: population_grid <- seq(30000, 70000, by = 100)\n\nfunding_data <- tibble(\n  population = population_grid,\n  running_var = population - 50000,\n  eligible = population >= 50000,\n  # Formula funding: approximately $40 per capita (middle of $30-50 range)\n  per_capita_funding = ifelse(population >= 50000, 40, 0),\n  total_funding_millions = (per_capita_funding * population) / 1e6\n)",

This shifts the outcome period well beyond the stated post-treatment years (treatment effective FY2012) and breaks alignment with the claimed running-variable/treatment/outcome timing, making the implemented data construction inconsistent with the paper\u2019s identifying strategy.",
