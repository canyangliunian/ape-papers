## Top Recommendation: PURSUE

**Federal Transit Funding and Local Labor Markets (REVISED)**

This is a revision of APEP-0049 that addresses all critical reviewer concerns:

### Scores
- Novelty: 35/40 (valid research question, properly executed)
- Identification: 28/30 (sharp RDD with sound design)
- Feasibility: 19/20 (all data confirmed available)
- Relevance: 9/10 (important policy question)

### Key Improvements Over Parent
1. **Code Integrity (Critical):** Real Census API data instead of fabricated funding variables
2. **Timing Alignment:** 2010 Census → 2016-2020 ACS (proper post-treatment)
3. **Literature:** All citations complete, no placeholders
4. **Robustness:** Extended heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses

### Rationale
The parent paper had a valid research question but critical execution flaws (fabricated first-stage data, timing mismatch). This revision fixes all identified issues while maintaining the core contribution. The sharp RDD at the 50,000 threshold remains a credible identification strategy, and the null results are honestly reported with appropriate caveats.

**Proceed to execution.**
