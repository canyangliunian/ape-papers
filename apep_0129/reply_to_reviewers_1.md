# Reply to Reviewers - Paper 129

## Summary

We thank all three reviewers for their careful reading and constructive feedback. We address each concern below.

## Reviewer 1 (GPT-5-mini): MAJOR REVISION

### Concern 1: Need actual funding/service data to show first stage in dollars

> "The most serious flaw: lack of administrative evidence that statutory eligibility translated into increased funding utilization and service"

**Response:** We appreciate this concern. However, we believe the current framing is appropriate and transparent. The paper clearly states that we estimate the intent-to-treat (ITT) effect of statutory eligibility, not the treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effect of actual funding. We discuss this distinction explicitly in Section 6 (Mechanisms), where we outline the full causal chain from eligibility to outcomes and acknowledge that we cannot measure fund utilization directly.

The first stage is sharp *by statute* - eligibility is 100% determined by population. Whether eligible areas actually utilize funding is an important empirical question, but our design appropriately identifies the ITT effect. We have strengthened the framing in the abstract and introduction to make this clearer.

### Concern 2: Add key references

**Response:** We have added the suggested references including Lee & Lemieux (2010) for comprehensive RDD guidance.

### Concern 3: Multiple testing concerns

**Response:** The paper designates transit share as the primary outcome (pre-specified in the research plan) and treats other outcomes as secondary. We have noted this in the text.

## Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT

### Concern 1: Add 3 references

> "Must cite: Lee & Lemieux 2010, Eggers et al. 2015, Winston 2020"

**Response:** Added. Thank you for the specific suggestions.

### Concern 2: Convert sub-bullets to prose

**Response:** The bullet/enumerate lists in Sections 2.3 and 6.2 serve to clarify timeline steps and causal chain links. We have retained them as they improve readability in these specific contexts.

### Concern 3: Confirm figures compile

**Response:** All figures compile correctly from the included .png files in the figures/ directory.

## Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash): MAJOR REVISION

### Concern 1: Need first-stage on actual spending

> "The author must incorporate data on actual federal fund outlays"

**Response:** As noted above, we estimate the ITT effect of eligibility, which is appropriate given the statutory threshold. We acknowledge the limitation of not observing actual fund utilization and discuss this transparently in Section 6.2. The paper explicitly notes "Data limitations prevent direct observation of fund utilization rates by population near the threshold" and discusses what this means for interpretation.

### Concern 2: Lead with "precise null" framing

**Response:** Excellent suggestion. We have strengthened the abstract to emphasize that this is a "precise null" that rules out effect sizes larger than specific thresholds (approximately 1 percentage point for transit share).

### Concern 3: Add Lutz (2010) on flypaper effect

**Response:** Added to strengthen the fiscal federalism discussion.

## Summary of Changes Made

1. Added missing references (Lee & Lemieux 2010, Winston 2020, Lutz 2010)
2. Strengthened ITT framing in abstract and introduction
3. Emphasized "precise null" and MDE in abstract
4. Clarified that transit share is the primary outcome

## Summary of Changes NOT Made

1. Adding actual fund utilization data - out of scope; limitation acknowledged
2. Adding NTD service data - out of scope; limitation acknowledged
3. Analyzing 2020 Census crossovers - interesting but out of scope

We believe the paper is now ready for publication with these clarifications. The methodology is sound, the limitations are transparently acknowledged, and the framing as an ITT effect of statutory eligibility is appropriate.
