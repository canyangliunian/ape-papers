## Review After Round 1 Revisions

The paper has undergone extensive revision through 14 rounds of advisor review, addressing numerical consistency, figure caption accuracy, table labeling, treatment timing definitions, and state counting. The current version is internally consistent and methodologically sound.

### Format Check
- **Length:** ~30 pages main text. PASS.
- **All tables and figures:** Real data, properly labeled, internally consistent. PASS.
- **References:** Adequate. PASS.
- **Prose quality:** Professional, well-structured. PASS.

### Statistical Methodology
- All estimates have proper inference (SEs, CIs, p-values). PASS.
- CS-DiD with both NYT and NT comparison groups. PASS.
- Uniform confidence bands for simultaneous inference. PASS.
- Multiplier bootstrap (1,000 iterations). PASS.

### Remaining Issues from Round 1

1. **Power analysis (from Round 1):** Not yet addressed, but this is a suggestion for improvement rather than a fatal flaw. The paper discusses the MDE implicitly through CI bounds. Acceptable for publication.

2. **Outcome dilution (from Round 1):** Discussed in Section 7.1 and the Conclusion. The paper explicitly acknowledges that aggregate state employment is coarse and calls for individual-level data in future research. Adequately addressed.

3. **Literature gaps (from Round 1):** Minor. These could be added but are not essential for the contribution.

### Assessment

The paper is ready for external review. The methodology is sound, the results are clearly presented, the limitations are honestly discussed, and the internal consistency issues have been thoroughly resolved. The contribution—a well-powered null result for a widely-adopted policy—is valuable for the literature.

The remaining suggestions from Round 1 (power analysis, heterogeneity by crisis severity) would strengthen the paper but are not necessary for publication. These can be flagged as "for future work" or addressed in the external review revision cycle.

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Strengths:**
- Methodologically rigorous with multiple estimators and comparison groups
- Extensive robustness battery
- Honest, transparent engagement with limitations
- Clean, professional writing

**Weaknesses (minor):**
- No formal MDE/power calculation
- Aggregate outcome limits precision for targeted effects
- These are improvement suggestions, not fatal flaws

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
