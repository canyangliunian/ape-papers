## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1) **Length (≥ 25 pages excl. refs/appendix)**: **PASS**  
- Pages are numbered through 30. References begin at p. 28 and Appendix at p. 30, implying ~27 pages of main text (pp. 1–27).

2) **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
- Bibliography lists **16** entries (Blau; Cahill et al.; Card et al.; Cohn & Passel; Compton & Pollak; Fitzpatrick & Moore; French; Gruber & Wise; Gustman & Steinmeier; Lee & Lemieux; Mastrobuoni; Munnell et al.; SSA; Stancanelli & Van Soest; Witman; Zamarro).

3) **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **FAIL**  
- **Introduction** contains a numbered list of research questions (the “1.” and “2.” hypotheses/questions). Under the rule “complete paragraphs (not bullet points),” this violates the requirement.  
- (Even though not required by your checklist, note also that Data/Variables sections use bullet lists extensively.)

4) **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **PASS**  
- Introduction, Literature, Methods, Results, and Conclusion each contain multiple substantive paragraphs (Data section also appears substantively developed across subsections).

5) **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not broken/empty)**: **PASS**  
- Figures shown (RDD plots and coefficient plot) clearly display points/intervals/axes and are not empty or malformed.

6) **Tables (real numbers; no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
- Tables report numeric estimates, SEs/p-values, Ns, and summary statistics; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Must-fix format issues (before Phase 2 content review)
- **Remove bullet/numbered-list formatting in the Introduction** (the enumerated research questions/hypotheses). Rewrite these as standard prose paragraphs (e.g., “We ask two questions. First, … Second, …”) rather than a numbered list.

Once that is fixed, the paper is ready for **Phase 2 (content review)** under your rules.
