\textit{Notes:} All specifications estimate the effect of salary transparency laws on log hourly wages. The main specification uses the Callaway \& Sant'Anna (2021) estimator with never-treated states as controls. Alternative specifications vary the estimator, control group, sample restrictions, and fixed effects. ``Upper 75\%'' restricts to workers above the 25th percentile of the pre-treatment wage distribution. ``Firm-size threshold'' interacts treatment with an indicator for states with all-employer coverage. Standard errors clustered at the state level.
