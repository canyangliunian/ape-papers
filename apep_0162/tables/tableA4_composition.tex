\textit{Notes:} Each row reports results from a separate TWFE regression of the listed composition variable on Treated $\times$ Post with state and year fixed effects, using the state-year panel. A significant coefficient would indicate differential compositional changes in treated states, raising concerns about selection. Standard errors clustered at the state level.
