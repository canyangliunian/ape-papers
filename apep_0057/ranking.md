# Paper 73: Idea Ranking

## Selected Idea

**Title:** Social Networks and Labor Market Co-Movement

**Score:** 75/100

**Recommendation:** PURSUE

## Rationale

This research idea uses Facebook's Social Connectedness Index in a novel way to examine labor market interdependencies. The shift-share design provides a clear empirical framework, though identification challenges (separating social networks from geographic proximity) are acknowledged upfront.

### Strengths
- Novel application of SCI data to labor economics
- Clear shift-share identification strategy
- Large sample size (3,200+ counties)
- COVID shock provides natural variation

### Weaknesses
- Cross-sectional SCI makes temporal analysis challenging
- Strong correlation between SCI and geography complicates identification
- Descriptive rather than cleanly causal

### Assessment
This paper will provide valuable descriptive evidence on labor market co-movement, with honest discussion of identification limits. Suitable for publication in regional economics or applied economics journals.
