# Internal Review Round 1

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Paper:** Social Networks and the Co-Movement of Local Labor Markets
**Date:** 2026-01-23

## Summary

This paper examines whether economic shocks propagate through social networks using Facebook's Social Connectedness Index. The main finding is a correlation between network exposure and own unemployment shocks, but the paper honestly acknowledges that this correlation may reflect geographic proximity rather than social network transmission.

## Strengths

1. Novel use of SCI data for labor market analysis
2. Transparent about identification challenges
3. Leave-out-state test reveals important patterns
4. Good figures visualizing the relationship

## Concerns

1. The "shift-share" framing may be misleading since we use outcomes, not exogenous shocks
2. ACS 5-year data overlaps significantly
3. State-clustered SEs may be inadequate for spatial dependence

## Recommendation

Proceed to external referee review to get detailed methodological feedback.
