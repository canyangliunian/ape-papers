# Initial Research Plan: Digital Exodus or Digital Magnet?

## Research Question

Do state comprehensive data privacy laws reshape the composition of the technology sector? Specifically, do privacy laws cause a **sorting equilibrium** in which privacy-enhancing firms (cybersecurity, encrypted communications, compliance technology) are attracted while surveillance-economy firms (ad tech, data brokers, targeted advertising) are repelled — potentially leaving net tech employment unchanged or even positive?

## Identification Strategy

**Staggered Difference-in-Differences** exploiting variation in the timing of state comprehensive data privacy law adoption across 20+ states from 2020 to 2025.

- **Treatment:** Effective date of state comprehensive privacy law (binary)
- **Estimator:** Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021) heterogeneity-robust DiD
- **Unit of analysis:** State × quarter (QCEW) or state × month (BFS)
- **Controls:** State + time FEs, state GDP growth, total employment, partisan composition
- **Robustness:** Sun & Abraham (2021), de Chaisemartin & d'Haultfoeuille (2020), HonestDiD sensitivity analysis, Fisher randomization inference, Wild Cluster Bootstrap

### Exposure Alignment

- **Who is actually treated?** All firms operating in states that enact comprehensive data privacy laws. Treatment applies to firms processing consumer data of state residents.
- **Primary estimand population:** Technology sector employees in treated states (NAICS 51, 5112, 5415), measured as state-level aggregate employment.
- **Placebo/control population:** Same industries in never-treated states (32 states + DC) and not-yet-treated states.
- **Design:** Staggered DiD (not triple-diff). Treatment varies at state × time level.

### Treatment Timing (Comprehensive Privacy Laws)

**20+ treated states with staggered adoption. 30+ never-treated states as controls.**

## Expected Effects and Mechanisms

### Primary Hypothesis: Sorting Equilibrium
- **H1a:** Privacy laws REDUCE employment in data-intensive sub-sectors (NAICS 5191 - data processing/hosting, 5182 - data storage, portions of 5121 - software with data models)
- **H1b:** Privacy laws INCREASE employment in privacy-enhancing sub-sectors (NAICS 5182 - cybersecurity, 5415 - IT consulting/compliance, portions of 5112 - privacy software)
- **H1c:** Net effect on total Information Sector (NAICS 51) employment is approximately ZERO or POSITIVE

### Secondary Hypothesis: Business Formation Sorting
- **H2:** Privacy laws increase applications for businesses in compliance-related categories while decreasing applications in data-broker categories, as measured by BFS sector-level data

### Mechanism: Worker and Capital Reallocation
- **H3:** Using IRS SOI migration data, high-income workers (AGI > $200k) show differential migration responses in high-tech vs. low-tech counties within treated states

### Counter-intuitive Prediction
The "Brussels Effect" hypothesis: regulation ATTRACTS certain types of economic activity by building consumer trust and creating first-mover advantage in privacy-compliant business models. If true, the net effect of privacy laws on tech employment is non-negative.

## Primary Specification

$$Y_{st} = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{PrivacyLaw}_{st} + \gamma_{s} + \delta_{t} + X_{st}'\phi + \varepsilon_{st}$$

Where:
- $Y_{st}$ = log employment in sector $k$ in state $s$ at time $t$
- $\text{PrivacyLaw}_{st}$ = 1 if state $s$ has an effective privacy law at time $t$
- $\gamma_{s}$ = state fixed effects
- $\delta_{t}$ = time fixed effects
- $X_{st}$ = time-varying state controls (GDP growth, total employment, political composition)

Estimated with Callaway-Sant'Anna for group-time ATTs, then aggregated.

## Planned Robustness Checks

1. **Pre-trend diagnostics:** Event-study plot showing no pre-treatment differential trends
2. **HonestDiD sensitivity:** Rambachan & Roth (2023) bounds under violations of parallel trends
3. **Randomization inference:** Fisher permutation test (randomly reassign treatment dates)
4. **Alternative estimators:** Sun & Abraham (2021), de Chaisemartin & d'Haultfoeuille (2020)
5. **Placebo outcomes:** Non-tech sectors (construction, retail) should show no effect
6. **Dose-response:** Laws with stronger enforcement provisions should have larger effects
7. **Spillover test:** Do neighboring states' privacy laws affect focal state employment?
8. **Concurrent policy controls:** COVID stimulus, state tax changes, federal tech regulation
