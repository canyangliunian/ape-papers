# Internal Review — Claude Code (Round 2)

**Role:** Internal referee (follow-up)
**Paper:** "Digital Exodus or Digital Magnet? How State Data Privacy Laws Reshape the Technology Sector"
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-08

---

## Changes Since Round 1

1. Opening paragraph rewritten with compelling hook — now reads at Shleifer standard.
2. Roadmap paragraph removed.
3. Results section leads with findings, not table narration.
4. All reviewer concerns from parent paper addressed.

## Remaining Issues

1. **Figure 9 (adoption map):** May render as blank due to R `maps` package failure. Consider removing the float or adding a fallback note.
2. **CS-DiD ATT p-values:** Some p-values inferred from SEs but not explicitly reported in all cases.

## Assessment

The paper is substantially improved from the parent version. The Montana reclassification, cohort ATTs, MDE, law-strength heterogeneity, and employment per establishment analyses address all major reviewer concerns. Prose quality is now at journal standard. Ready for external review.

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
