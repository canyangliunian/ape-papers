# Research Ideas

## Idea 1: Digital Exodus or Digital Magnet? How State Data Privacy Laws Reshape the Tech Sector
**Policy:** State comprehensive data privacy laws (CCPA-type). 20+ states with staggered adoption: California (Jan 2020), Virginia (Jan 2023), Colorado (Jul 2023), Connecticut (Jul 2023), Utah (Dec 2023), Iowa (Jan 2025), Oregon (Jul 2024), Tennessee (Jul 2025), Indiana (Jan 2026), Montana (Oct 2024), Delaware (Jan 2025), Texas (Jul 2024), plus more.
**Outcome:** (1) Census Business Formation Statistics — monthly state-level new business applications by NAICS sector (Information Sector 51 vs. all others). (2) BLS QCEW — quarterly county-level employment and wages for NAICS 51 (Information), 5112 (Software Publishers), 5415 (Computer Systems Design). (3) IRS Statistics of Income Migration Data — interstate income flows by AGI bracket, testing whether high-income tech workers flee privacy-law states.
**Identification:** Staggered DiD with Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator. Treatment = effective date of comprehensive privacy law. Pre-periods: 5+ years of monthly BFS data, 2015-present. Treated units: 20+ states staggered across 2020-2025. Controls: never-treated states.
**Why it's novel:** The existing literature (including APEP-0090 and the Goldberg-Johnson NBER working paper) treats data privacy laws as uniformly negative for firms. Our innovation is to decompose the effect by sector and firm type, revealing a SORTING EQUILIBRIUM: privacy laws attract privacy-enhancing firms (cybersecurity, encrypted communications, VPNs) while repelling surveillance-economy firms (ad tech, data brokers). The net effect on tech employment may be positive because regulation builds consumer trust — the "Brussels Effect" at the state level. We test this sorting prediction by comparing sub-sector employment patterns and using IRS migration data to trace worker flows.
**Feasibility check:** BFS data freely downloadable from Census (tested: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/econ/bfs/business-formation-statistics.html). QCEW data freely downloadable from BLS (tested). IRS SOI migration data freely available (tested: https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data). 20+ treated states with clear effective dates from NCSL database. Not overstudied — only one NBER working paper and APEP-0090 (which used only total business formation, not sector decomposition).

## Idea 2: The Cost of Ideology: How Anti-ESG Laws Raise Government Borrowing Costs
**Policy:** State anti-ESG financial laws restricting pension investments and financial institution contracting. 15+ states enacted laws 2021-2024 (Texas 2021, Oklahoma 2022, Florida/Indiana/Kansas/Missouri/Montana/North Carolina 2023, etc.).
**Outcome:** Census Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances (interest expenditure and total debt). FRED series for national muni bond yields as control. BLS QCEW for financial sector employment.
**Identification:** Staggered DiD. Treatment = enactment date of anti-ESG boycott/divestment law. Outcome = state government interest expenditure relative to total expenditure.
**Why it's novel:** The Wharton/Fed Chicago study examines only Texas. No systematic multi-state DiD using modern heterogeneity-robust estimators exists. The novel theoretical concept is "Ideological Regulation Costs" — analogous to trade barriers, ideological restrictions on market participants create deadweight loss by reducing competition.
**Feasibility check:** Census government finance data available but 2-year lag limits post-treatment observation. Only 15 treated states, and clustering occurred in 2023. Partially scooped by Texas-specific studies. DATA ACCESS CONCERN: state-level muni bond yield data not readily available on FRED. Would need EMMA/MSRB subscription data.

## Idea 3: Lights Out for Green? Renewable Energy Mandates and Power Grid Reliability
**Policy:** Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). 30+ states with staggered adoption from 1997 to 2015.
**Outcome:** EAGLE-I power outage data from DOE/ORNL — county-level, 15-minute intervals, 2014-2022. Over 146 million customers covered (92% of US).
**Identification:** Staggered DiD exploiting variation in RPS adoption timing across states. Outcome = county-quarterly outage frequency and duration.
**Why it's novel:** Tests whether renewable energy mandates increase or decrease grid reliability. Conventional wisdom says diversification helps; intermittency concern says it hurts. The 15-minute granularity allows analysis of WHEN outages occur (peak vs. off-peak), testing the intermittency mechanism directly.
**Feasibility check:** EAGLE-I data requires Globus account download — large dataset. RPS adoption dates well-documented by NCSL and DSIRE. 30+ treated states with excellent staggering. However, 2014 data start means limited pre-periods for early RPS adopters. DATA ACCESS CONCERN: EAGLE-I download via Globus may be complex.

## Idea 4: Do State Drug Policy Reforms Change Health-Seeking Behavior? Evidence from Google Trends
**Policy:** (1) Recreational marijuana legalization (24 states, 2012-2024). (2) Good Samaritan/naloxone access laws (40+ states, 2007-2020). (3) Must-access PDMP mandates (30+ states, 2012-2022).
**Outcome:** Google Trends state-level search data for health-seeking terms: "drug rehab near me," "addiction help," "how to quit," "naloxone near me," "marijuana dispensary." Weekly state-level data via gtrendsR package.
**Identification:** Staggered DiD. Multiple policies provide stacking variation. Event-study specifications around adoption dates.
**Why it's novel:** Google Trends captures REVEALED PREFERENCES for health-seeking, free from self-report bias. The novel theoretical prediction: decriminalization increases help-seeking (stigma falls, people feel safe searching) while legalization may decrease it (behavior is normalized). This distinguishes a stigma-reduction channel from a normalization channel.
**Feasibility check:** Google Trends freely accessible via gtrendsR R package. Policy dates well-documented. Massive sample (50 states × weekly × 10+ years). CONCERN: Google Trends data is normalized (0-100 index), creating potential measurement issues. May need careful methodological handling.

## Idea 5: The Banking Desert Paradox: How Cannabis Legalization Reduces Financial Access
**Policy:** State recreational marijuana legalization. 24 states with staggered adoption from 2012 (Colorado, Washington) to 2024.
**Outcome:** FDIC Summary of Deposits — every bank branch location in the US with deposit levels. Annual, 1994-present. ~80,000 branches geocoded.
**Identification:** Staggered DiD. Treatment = state recreational cannabis legalization date. Outcome = number of bank branches per capita, total deposits, branch entry/exit.
**Why it's novel:** Federal illegality of cannabis creates a "banking paradox": legalization brings an industry into the legal economy but, because banks face federal compliance risk, it may actually REDUCE financial infrastructure access. Banks close branches near dispensary-heavy areas. This is a genuinely counter-intuitive unintended consequence.
**Feasibility check:** FDIC data freely downloadable. Cannabis legalization dates well-documented. However, identification concern: branch closures are a slow-moving outcome, and the concurrent decline in physical branches (general trend) must be carefully controlled. Sample size (annual data, state-level) may be underpowered relative to other ideas.
