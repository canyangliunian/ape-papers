PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES

The paper fails the structural review on multiple counts. It is **NOT** ready for content review. The following issues must be addressed:

1.  **References**: The bibliography (Section 8/References, page 31) contains only **9 citations**. The requirement is at least **15**. The literature review is thin and missing foundational texts in labor economics and time use.

2.  **Prose Quality**: The paper relies on **bullet points** to present core arguments and findings in the **Results** (Section 5.2.1, page 17; Section 5.2.2, pages 18-19) and **Conclusion** (page 30) sections. Academic economics papers must present findings and narratives in complete prose paragraphs.

3.  **Figures**: There are **blank pages** where figures are intended to be.
    *   **Page 15** is completely blank (intended for Figure 1, referenced on page 14).
    *   **Page 16** and **Page 23** are also blank placeholders.
    *   A paper cannot be reviewed with missing visual evidence.

**Action Required**:
*   Expand the bibliography to include at least 15 relevant academic citations.
*   Rewrite Sections 5.2 and 7 to convert bulleted lists into proper prose paragraphs.
*   Ensure all figures (specifically Figure 1 and any figures intended for pages 16/23) are correctly rendered in the PDF.

**VERDICT: REJECT (Format)**
