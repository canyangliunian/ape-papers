## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excl. references/appendix)**: **PASS**  
   - Approx. pagination shown runs to p. 30 for the main text, with **References on p. 31** and **Appendix starting p. 32**. That implies **~30 pages** of main text.

2. **References (≥15 items in bibliography)**: **FAIL**  
   - Bibliography contains **~9 references** (Aguiar & Hurst; Card et al.; Cattaneo et al.; Fitzpatrick & Moore; French; Gelber et al.; Hamermesh & Lee; Mastrobuoni; Wilmot et al.). This is well below 15.

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **FAIL**  
   - Multiple key sections use **bulleted lists** instead of full prose paragraphs (notably **Introduction**, **Data/Simulated Data Disclosure**, **Results**, **Discussion**, and “Interpretation: Where Does Work Time Go?”).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **FAIL**  
   - Several major sections/subsections appear to have **too few substantive paragraphs** and rely on bullets or short blocks (e.g., **2.1–2.4**, parts of **Section 3**, parts of **5.2**, and parts of **6**). Under the stated rule, this fails even if the overall paper is long.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; none broken/empty)**: **PASS**  
   - Figures shown (e.g., Figures 2–4) appear to contain plotted points/lines and labeled axes; none are obviously blank or broken in the provided excerpt.

6. **Tables (no placeholders; real numbers)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables 1–9 report numeric estimates/SEs/p-values/N; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders are visible.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Expand the bibliography to ≥15 references.** You currently have ~9.  
2. **Replace bullet points with complete paragraphs** in the required sections (Introduction, Literature Review, Results, Discussion). Bullets can remain sparingly in an appendix, but not as the main exposition.  
3. **Ensure each major section (Intro, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion)** has **3–4 substantive prose paragraphs** (not short stubs and not lists). This likely requires expanding Section 2 (each subsection), Sections 3, 5.2, and 6, and tightening/restructuring so the narrative is paragraph-based.

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2** until these format issues are addressed.
