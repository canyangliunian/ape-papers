\textit{Notes:} All specifications estimate the effect of salary transparency laws on log hourly wages. The main specification uses the Callaway \& Sant'Anna (2021) estimator with never-treated states as controls. Alternative specifications vary the estimator, control group, sample restrictions, and fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the state level (51 clusters; 6 treated states with post-treatment data, 43 never-treated + DC, 2 treated without post-treatment observations). Unweighted individual-level sample $\approx$ 650,000 person-years.
