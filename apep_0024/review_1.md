## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1) **Length (≥ 25 pages excl. refs/appendix): FAIL**  
- The manuscript appears to run to **~23 pages total including references** (page numbers shown through **p. 23**).  
- Excluding the references, the main text is roughly **~20–21 pages**, which is **below 25 pages**.

2) **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography): FAIL**  
- The bibliography lists **~12 references** (Bitler & Hoynes; Card et al.; Currie & Gruber; Duggan et al.; Finkelstein & McKnight; Ganong & Liebman; Garthwaite et al.; Kaestner et al.; Kleven & Waseem; Meyer & Rosenbaum; Romig; Saez).  
- This is **below 15**.

3) **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): FAIL**  
- The **Introduction** uses bullet points to describe the policy discontinuity (“Below 100% FPL… Above 100% FPL…”) and also uses enumerated contribution bullets (“This paper makes three contributions. First… Second… Third…”).  
- Under your rule (“If ANY of these sections use bullet points instead of prose, FAIL”), this is a **FAIL**.

4) **Section Completeness (each major section has ≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs): PASS (tentative)**  
- **Introduction**: multiple substantive paragraphs (despite bullets).  
- **Literature/Prior literature**: appears to have multiple paragraphs (though relatively brief).  
- **Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion**: each appears to have multiple paragraphs.

5) **Figures (all contain visible data): PASS**  
- The shown figures (income distribution histogram; RD plots; cross-state comparison) all display plotted data with axes and a visible threshold line.

6) **Tables (no placeholders; real numbers): PASS**  
- Tables shown contain numeric estimates, SEs, p-values, Ns; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before Phase 2:
1) **Increase paper length** to **≥ 25 pages of main text** (excluding references/appendix). As currently formatted, it appears short of the requirement.  
2) **Expand the bibliography to ≥ 15 references** (you are currently at ~12).  
3) **Replace bullet points with full prose paragraphs** in the **Introduction** (and ensure the Literature Review/Results/Discussion contain no bullet lists either).  

Per instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2 (content review)** until these are addressed.
