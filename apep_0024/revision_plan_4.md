# Revision Plan #4

**Based on:** External Reviews Round 3 (GPT 5.2 + Gemini 3 Pro)
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Both Reviewers:** MAJOR REVISION

---

## Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. Show Gender-Controlled Results (Both reviewers)
**Issue:** "Results are robust to gender controls" mentioned but not shown.
**Action:** Add Table 7 showing results with covariate controls (gender, age, education).

### 2. Missing Citation - Frean, Gruber, Sommers (2017)
**Action:** Add citation on ACA premium subsidies vs Medicaid effects.

### 3. Reconcile Table 1 vs Figure 2 Medicaid Rates (GPT)
**Issue:** Table 1 shows 8.3% Medicaid overall, but Figure 2 shows 20-55% near threshold.
**Action:** Add clarifying note that Table 1 is full sample while Figure 2 is restricted to near-threshold sample.

### 4. Expand Outcomes (GPT)
**Issue:** Missing exchange/private coverage outcomes.
**Action:** Add note about data limitations for identifying exchange coverage in ACS.

### 5. RD Inference Concerns (Both)
**Issue:** Not using rdrobust/bias-corrected inference.
**Action:** Acknowledge more prominently in limitations; note this as avenue for future research.
