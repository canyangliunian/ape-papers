PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES

The paper is **NOT** ready for content review due to multiple violations of the structural requirements. The following issues must be remediated before the paper can be reviewed for academic content:

1.  **Length**: **FAIL**. The paper is approximately 23 pages total (including references), with the main text ending on page 21. The requirement is at least 25 pages excluding references/appendix.
2.  **References**: **FAIL**. The bibliography (pages 22-23) contains 12 references. The requirement is a minimum of 15 citations.
3.  **Prose Quality**: **FAIL**. The paper relies heavily on bullet points and numbered lists rather than continuous academic prose in several major sections:
    *   **Introduction (Page 3)**: Uses bullet points to describe eligibility thresholds.
    *   **Theoretical Framework (Pages 5-6)**: Uses a numbered list to describe factors affecting labor supply.
    *   **Data and Sample Construction (Pages 7-8)**: Uses a numbered list for sample inclusion criteria.
    *   **Outcomes (Page 9)**: Uses a numbered list to define variables.
    *   **Summary of Findings (Page 19)**: Uses a numbered list to summarize results.
    *   *Correction Required*: These lists must be converted into full paragraphs.

**VERDICT: REJECT (FORMATTING)**
*Do not proceed to Phase 2 until these structural issues are resolved.*
