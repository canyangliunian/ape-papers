- Expand Literature Review with more citations and discussion
- Add a Mechanisms section discussing why no labor supply effect
- Expand Limitations and Future Research

### 2. References: FAIL (Currently 12, need 15+)
**Action:** Add 3+ more citations:

- Imbens and Lemieux (2008) - RDD practical guide
- Sommers et al. (2012) - Medicaid expansion health effects
- Baicker et al. (2013) - Oregon Medicaid experiment

### 3. Prose Quality: FAIL (Bullet points in multiple sections)
