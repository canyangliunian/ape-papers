## Response to GPT 5.2

Thank you for the thorough content review. We have addressed all major issues.

### Issue 1: Table 6 Missing Inference (CRITICAL)
**Response:** Table 6 has been completely revised to include:
- Standard errors in parentheses for all estimates
- Sample sizes (N) for both Wisconsin and expansion states
- A formal difference-in-discontinuities estimate showing the Wisconsin-specific effect

### Issue 2: Discrete Running Variable
**Response:** We now cite Kolesár and Rothe (2018) and explicitly acknowledge in the Limitations section that "the running variable (POVPIP) is discrete—an integer percentage of poverty—rather than continuous" and that "standard RD inference can be misleading with discrete running variables."

### Issue 3: Confounding ACA Subsidy Threshold
**Response:** We have:
- Added the difference-in-discontinuities estimate to Table 6
- Cited Grembi, Nannicini, Troiano (2016) on diff-in-disc methods
- Expanded the Limitations section to acknowledge this issue and explain our approach

### Issue 4: Missing Modern RD Citations
**Response:** Added all requested citations:
- Calonico, Cattaneo, Titiunik (2014) - rdrobust
- Kolesár & Rothe (2018) - discrete running variable
- Grembi, Nannicini, Troiano (2016) - diff-in-disc
- Gelman & Imbens (2019) - against high-order polynomials

### Issue 5: Covariate Imbalance / Placebo Concerns
**Response:** We have substantially revised the paper to:
- Acknowledge the gender imbalance more prominently in Limitations
- Note that robustness checks controlling for gender produce similar results
- Soften claims from "no labor supply distortion" to "no evidence of distortion"
- Explicitly discuss the placebo failure at 125% FPL as a limitation

### Issue 6: Overstated Conclusions
**Response:** The Summary of Findings, Interpretation, and Conclusion sections have all been revised to present more cautious claims that match what the design can credibly deliver.

## Response to Gemini 3 Pro

### Issue 1: Covariate Imbalance - Gender (CRITICAL)
**Response:** We now prominently acknowledge the gender imbalance in the Limitations section and note that "robustness checks controlling for gender (not shown) produce similar point estimates, but the imbalance remains a concern."

### Issue 2: Missing Wisconsin Literature (CRITICAL)
**Response:** We have added extensive discussion of prior Wisconsin research:
- Cited Dague et al. (2017) on labor supply effects in BadgerCare Core
- Cited DeLeire et al. (2013) on Wisconsin's expansion experience
- Cited Burns & Dague (2017) on Medicaid expansion
- Added new paragraph in Literature Review comparing our setting to prior work
- Added "Comparison to Prior Wisconsin Research" section in Interpretation

### Issue 3: Reframe Employment Result
**Response:** The Summary of Findings section now explicitly states:
- "no statistically significant evidence of labor supply distortions"
- "data limitations prevent ruling out modest effects"
- Acknowledges the placebo test failure at 125% FPL
- States this "should be interpreted cautiously as 'no evidence of labor supply distortion' rather than definitive evidence that no distortion exists"

### Issue 4: Compare to Dague (2017)
**Response:** Added new subsection "Comparison to Prior Wisconsin Research" in the Interpretation section that directly compares our null finding to Dague et al. (2017) and explains why results may differ (ACA subsidies vs. uninsurance).
