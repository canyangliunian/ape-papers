## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - Approximate pagination: main text runs from p.1 through p.21, with **References starting on p.22** and **Appendix starting on p.24** (figures shown through p.26).  
   - Excluding references/appendix, the paper is **~21 pages**, below the 25-page minimum.

2. **References (≥15 citations)**: **PASS**  
   - Bibliography contains **~22 references** (well above 15).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet-point sections in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **PASS**  
   - These sections are written in paragraph form (no bullet lists substituting for prose).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, and Conclusion each appear to have multiple substantive paragraphs.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not broken/empty)**: **PASS**  
   - Figure 1 and Figure 2 both display plotted series/estimates with axes and visible content.

6. **Tables (all tables have real numbers; no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables include numeric entries and standard errors; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Issues that must be fixed (before content review)
- **Increase main-text length to at least 25 pages (excluding references and appendix).**  
  Currently, the narrative/core paper ends around **p.21** (with references beginning p.22). You need **~4+ additional pages** of substantive main-text content (not moved references/appendix pages).  

Do **not** proceed to Phase 2 until the length requirement is met.
