# Revision Plan - Round 2 (External Review Response)

## GPT 5.2 Verdict: REJECT AND RESUBMIT

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Length (currently 15 pages, need 25+)
- Expand institutional background
- Add conceptual framework section
- Expand related literature
- Add more robustness discussion
- Include full triple-diff results

### 2. Few-cluster inference
- Add note about randomization inference / wild bootstrap limitations
- Acknowledge this is a limitation of the design

### 3. Internal inconsistencies
- Clarify individual vs state-year analysis
- Explain California exclusion consistently
- Fix timing issues

### 4. Design improvements (feasibility limited)
- Already have triple-diff in robustness - need to include in main text
- Synthetic DiD: would require substantial new code
- Note: fundamental issue is pre-trends, not estimator choice

### 5. Literature expansion
- Add Conley & Taber (2011)
- Add Cameron, Gelbach & Miller (2008)
- Add Arkhangelsky et al. (2021)
- Add Ruhm (1998)

### 6. Production quality
- Fix encoding artifacts (if any)
- Clean up presentation

## Implementation Priority

Given time constraints, focus on:
1. Clarify methodology and level of observation
2. Include triple-diff prominently
3. Expand literature
4. Acknowledge few-cluster inference limitations
5. Expand paper length with substantive content

## Note

The fundamental criticism - that pre-trends fail and no design can fix that - is acknowledged in the paper. The paper is framed as a methodological cautionary tale. Given the constraints, we will make targeted improvements but the paper may remain at MAJOR REVISION level.
