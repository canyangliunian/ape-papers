## Response to External Reviewer (GPT 5.2) - Round 3

### Major Concerns Addressed

**1. Institutional facts about PFL states.** Added footnote clarifying that additional states (MA, CT, DC) have adopted PFL but are excluded because they adopted after 2020, providing insufficient post-treatment data and coinciding with COVID disruptions.

**2. Missing 95% CIs.** Added CI row to main results Table 3 with 95% confidence intervals for all three estimators.

**3. Outcome measurement (employed-at-work vs employed-absent).** Added discussion in Section 5.4 (Data Limitations) acknowledging that our employment definition includes "employed, with a job but not at work" which could mechanically inflate measured employment if PFL enables leave-taking without job loss.

**4. Additional literature.** Added citations:
   - Baker, Larcker & Wang (2022) on staggered DiD cautions
   - Baker & Milligan (2008) on Canadian maternity leave
   - Ben-Michael, Feller & Rothstein (2021) on augmented synthetic control

**5. C-S inference details.** Clarified in Table 3 notes that C-S uses bootstrap SEs (1000 replications, state-level clustering).

### Core Criticism Response

The reviewer's fundamental criticism that the paper "stops where a top-journal paper must begin" is acknowledged. The paper is framed as a cautionary tale showing that a popular research design fails. This has value for applied researchers but may not meet top-journal standards without an alternative identification strategy.

### Summary

Paper is now 32 pages with improved tables, clearer institutional description, and additional literature.
