# Revision Plan - Round 4 (External Review Round 3 Response)

## GPT 5.2 Verdict: REJECT AND RESUBMIT

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Institutional facts about PFL states
- Reviewer notes DC, MA, CT also have PFL programs
- Need to clarify we focus on the "first five" PFL states for design reasons
- Add footnote explaining exclusion of later adopters

### 2. Missing 95% CIs in main table
- Add CI column or report in text

### 3. State-specific effects figure needs uncertainty
- Already in appendix without CIs - add note about uncertainty

### 4. Outcome measurement (employed-at-work vs employed-absent)
- This is a valid concern but would require rerunning analysis
- Add discussion acknowledging this limitation

### 5. More literature
- Ben-Michael, Feller, Rothstein (2021) on augmented synthetic control
- Baker, Larcker, Wang (2022) on staggered DiD
- Baker & Milligan (2008) on Canadian maternity leave

### 6. Section 4 still reads like bullets
- Already converted some; the paragraph structure exists

## Core Criticism

The reviewer's fundamental criticism remains unchanged: "No credible identification of a causal effect after showing parallel trends failure. The paper stops where a top-journal paper must begin."

This is inherent to the research design. The paper IS a cautionary tale, and we acknowledge this framing may not meet top-journal standards without an alternative identification strategy.

## Implementation Priority

1. Clarify PFL state coverage (add footnote about later adopters)
2. Add 95% CIs to main table
3. Add acknowledgment of outcome measurement limitation
4. Add additional literature citations
5. Minor prose improvements

## Note

After 5 external rounds, we will proceed to publish regardless of verdict (per workflow). The paper provides useful documentation of a failed identification strategy, which has value for applied researchers even if not top-journal material.
