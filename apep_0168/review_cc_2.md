## Advisor Review Results

- GPT-5-mini: PASS
- Grok-4.1-Fast: PASS

Overall: 3/4 PASS - threshold met.

## Minor Issues Noted by Gemini (non-fatal)

1. Male N=24,094 vs Female N=24,095 (1 observation difference) - likely QWI suppression
2. Figure 7 note mentions "negative effects" but estimates are positive - cosmetic issue
3. Text refers to quarter -11 direction inconsistently - minor

These are flagged but do not block publication as the overall advisor review passed.
