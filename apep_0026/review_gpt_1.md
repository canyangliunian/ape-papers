## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **PASS**  
   - The document appears to run to at least **28 pages** (page numbers shown through p. 28), so it meets the length requirement.

2. **References (≥15 bibliography entries)**: **FAIL**  
   - The bibliography shown contains **4 entries** (Cerdá et al. 2020; Dragone et al. 2019; Grembi et al. 2016; McCrary 2008). This is far below the minimum of 15.

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet-point sections in Intro/Lit Review/Results/Discussion)**: **PASS**  
   - The displayed sections are written in full paragraphs; no bullet-point writing is evident in the relevant sections.

4. **Section Completeness (Intro, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion each with 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **FAIL**  
   - There is **no standalone “Literature Review” section** in the table of contents. The introduction briefly lists contributions, but this does not satisfy the requirement that the **Literature** section exists and contains 3–4 substantive paragraphs engaging prior work.

5. **Figures (all figures show visible data; not broken/empty)**: **PASS**  
   - Figure 1 shows plotted points/lines and labeled axes; it does not appear empty or broken.

6. **Tables (all tables have real numbers; no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables shown (summary statistics, main results, placebo tests, heterogeneity, bandwidth sensitivity) contain numeric entries and no placeholders like “TBD/XXX”.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. **Expand the bibliography to at least 15 citations** (currently ~4). This needs to include both:
   - Core domain literature on marijuana legalization and labor market outcomes, and
   - Core methods literature on RD/diff-in-discontinuities and inference with few clusters.
2. **Add a substantive Literature Review section** (or equivalent) with **at least 3–4 substantive paragraphs** that:
   - Positions the paper relative to existing marijuana-policy and labor-market research,
   - Discusses prior entrepreneurship/self-employment determinants literature,
   - Clearly differentiates your contribution and why diff-in-disc at age 21 adds value.

Per your instructions, I will **not proceed to Phase 2** until these Phase 1 issues are addressed.
