PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES

The paper is not ready for content review due to the following structural deficiencies that must be addressed:

1.  **References**: **FAIL**. The bibliography lists only 4 references. A standard economics working paper requires a minimum of 15-20 citations to establish the contribution relative to existing literature. You are missing critical citations regarding:
    *   Labor market effects of Medical Marijuana Laws (MML) and Recreational Marijuana Laws (RML) (e.g., D. Mark Anderson, Joseph Sabia, Nicolas Ziebarth).
    *   Methodological papers on Difference-in-Discontinuities (beyond Grembi et al.) and RDD best practices (Cattaneo et al.).
    *   Determinants of self-employment and "entrepreneurship vs. gig work".
    *   Gender differences in risk aversion and labor supply.

2.  **Prose Quality (Minor)**: While mostly written in prose, Section 4.3 uses a bulleted list to define variables. In top-tier economics journals, variable definitions following an equation are typically written in continuous prose (e.g., "where $Y_{ias}$ denotes..., $Above21_{ia}$ is an indicator..., and $Treat_s$ represents...").

**Action Required**:
Please conduct a thorough literature review, integrate relevant citations into the Introduction and Literature Review sections, and expand the bibliography to meet the minimum requirement of 15 citations before resubmitting for content review.
