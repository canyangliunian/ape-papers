\textit{Notes:} Standard deviations in parentheses. Treated states had at least one
minimum wage increase during 2018--2024. Never-treated states remained at the federal minimum (\$7.25).
Of the 30 treated states, 21 were first treated in 2018 (the first year of the panel) and are excluded from the primary CS estimation, which uses 9 treated states across 4 cohorts (2019--2023).
