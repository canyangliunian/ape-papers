# Internal Claude Code Review — apep_0325 v1

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (claude-opus-4-6)
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Verdict:** PASS (with caveats noted below)

## Summary

This paper examines the effect of state minimum wage increases on Medicaid HCBS provider supply using T-MSIS data (2018-2024). The Callaway-Sant'Anna DiD estimator finds a -16.1% effect (p=0.069) using 9 treated states in 4 cohorts vs 21 never-treated controls. A falsification test on non-HCBS providers yields a null (p=0.47).

## Strengths

1. **Novel data**: T-MSIS provider-level claims data released Feb 2026 — first use in academic research
2. **Clean identification**: Staggered adoption with never-treated controls; heterogeneity-robust CS estimator
3. **Strong falsification**: Non-HCBS providers unaffected (same shock, different workforce wage level)
4. **Comprehensive robustness**: Not-yet-treated controls, anticipation effects, leave-one-out, continuous treatment, region FEs
5. **Honest reporting**: Marginal significance transparently discussed as power limitation

## Issues Identified and Addressed

1. **Marginal significance (p=0.069)**: Acknowledged as power limitation; TWFE with all 30 states yields p<0.001
2. **ARPA confounding**: Discussed in Institutional Background and new Limitations subsection
3. **Outcome validity**: Billing NPIs vs. actual capacity — discussed in Limitations
4. **2023 cohort SE**: Single-state cohort flagged with appropriate caveat
5. **Pre-trend at t=-2**: Positive sign (opposite to treatment effect); joint Wald test p=0.324

## Remaining Caveats

- Wild cluster bootstrap not implemented (fwildclusterboot + CS not yet mature in R)
- Reimbursement rate rigidity assumed but not directly demonstrated
- Pre-2021 subsample analysis would strengthen ARPA confounding argument

## Code Integrity

- All R scripts run end-to-end without errors
- Figures regenerated from analysis output (no stale exhibits)
- Tables generated by 06_tables.R (no hand-coded values except verified state assignments)
- Data sourced from real APIs (T-MSIS HHS, NPPES, FRED, Census ACS)

## Recommendation

PASS. The paper makes a genuine contribution with novel data and clean identification. The marginal significance is a real limitation but is honestly reported and consistent across specifications.
