## Response to GPT-5-mini

### Concern 1: Missing methodological references
**Response:** We have added citations to Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021), Goodman-Bacon (2021), Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004), and Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2016). We have also added a paragraph in the Identification Challenges section explaining how our design differs from the staggered DiD settings these methods address.

### Concern 2: Formal event-study specification
**Response:** We clarify in the revised manuscript that our design differs fundamentally from staggered DiD. We have a continuous exposure (technology age) observed at multiple time points, not a binary treatment adopted at different times. Our event-study approach estimates whether the correlation between technology age and voting changed over time. The temporal pattern we document (null in 2012, significant thereafter) is robust to this specification.

### Concern 3: Conley spatial SEs
**Response:** We report state-level clustering as robustness, which addresses spatial correlation at a higher geographic level. The main results remain significant. We note this as a limitation and suggest Conley SEs as future robustness.

### Concern 4: Migration/sorting tests
**Response:** Direct migration tests would require additional data beyond the scope of this revision. We have strengthened the mechanisms discussion and note this as a fruitful direction for future research.

### Concern 5: Convert enumerated list to prose
**Response:** Done. Section 6.1 now presents findings in paragraph form.

## Response to Grok-4.1-Fast

### Concern 1: Missing references
**Response:** Added Goodman-Bacon (2021), Chetty et al. (2016), and other suggested references.

### Concern 2: Convert §6.1 list to prose
**Response:** Done.

### Concern 3: Overall assessment
We appreciate the positive assessment and have incorporated the suggested improvements.

## Response to Gemini-3-Flash

### Concern 1: Industry-by-year fixed effects
**Response:** The appendix includes industry controls (Table 10). We note that technology age is correlated with industry mix and that this is a limitation of the observational design.

### Concern 2: Migration data
**Response:** Noted as future research direction. The sorting interpretation we propose is consistent with the observed temporal patterns even without direct migration tests.

### Concern 3: Alternative populism measures
**Response:** This is an interesting suggestion for future work. Our current data focus on presidential elections; extending to primary elections would require additional data collection.
