## Recommendation: PURSUE

## Reasoning

This idea applies novel technology vintage data (modal_age.dta) to test whether technological obsolescence predicts support for populist candidates. The data are readily available and cover 917 CBSAs from 2010-2023. County-level election data can be aggregated to CBSAs using NBER crosswalks.

The identification strategy relies on:
1. Cross-sectional variation in technology age across CBSAs
2. Within-CBSA variation over time (via fixed effects)
3. Gains specifications testing whether initial technology predicts vote share changes

The research question is highly policy-relevant given ongoing debates about the economic roots of populism and Trump's electoral success.

**Key limitation:** Cannot establish causation definitively. The gains specification provides the cleanest test.
