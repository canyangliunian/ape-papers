## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-5

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0141
**Parent Title:** Technological Obsolescence and Populist Voting: Evidence from U.S. Metropolitan Areas
**Parent Decision:** MINOR REVISION (2/3 majority)
**Revision Rationale:** User request - paper is too long and "a slog to read." Goal: aggressive streamlining, push robustness to appendix, focus on central message/value added, polish extensively.

## Key Changes Planned

1. **Aggressive length reduction** - Cut main text from ~35 pages to 25-28 pages
2. **Move robustness to appendix** - All detailed robustness checks (terciles, regional heterogeneity, alternative measures, clustering, Oster details, mechanisms details) moved to expanded appendix
3. **Tighten Introduction** - Remove redundant restatements of main finding
4. **Streamline institutional background** - Move detailed context to appendix
5. **Focus results on key tests** - Keep main table, by-year, gains, 2008 baseline, event study, maps
6. **Polish prose** - Sharper transitions, remove passive voice, clearer magnitudes

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **GPT-5-mini (Major Revision):** Spatial HAC, within-CBSA variation, pre-trend tests - keeping core robustness but moving details to appendix
2. **Grok-4.1-Fast (Minor Revision):** No major concerns - polish requested
3. **Gemini-3-Flash (Minor Revision):** Industry fixed effects, measurement construction suggestions - noting in limitations

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Does technological obsolescence predict support for populist candidates?
- Identification strategy: Cross-sectional + gains + 2008 baseline controls (observational)
- Primary data source: Technology vintage data (Acemoglu et al. 2022), MIT Election Lab
- Key finding: Technology age predicts 2012→2016 gains (Trump emergence) but NOT subsequent changes. One-time sorting event.
