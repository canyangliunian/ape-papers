We thank the referee and editor for their constructive feedback. Below we address each point.

## Response to Major Concerns

### 1. Paper structure buries invalidity finding

**Response:** We agree. We have substantially revised the paper to lead with the methodological contribution:

- **New title:** "When Age Thresholds Fail: A Cautionary Tale About RDD Validity for Life-Course Outcomes"
- **Revised abstract:** Now emphasizes the balance test failure as the central finding
- **Revised introduction:** Opens with the methodological point about RDD validity

### 2. Limited novelty / overpowering concern

**Response:** We have added a new section (8.1) "Statistical Significance, Effect Sizes, and Overpowering" that directly addresses this concern. We discuss:

- Effect sizes in standard deviation units (0.12 SD)
- Why even "small" imbalances are problematic when covariates strongly predict the outcome
- How large samples reveal patterns that would be missed in smaller studies

We agree the finding that life-course transitions cluster at milestone ages is not novel in itself. The contribution is demonstrating the practical implications for RDD validity assessment.

### 3. Age 27 finding not explained

**Response:** We have expanded discussion of this finding in Section 8.1. The significance at age 27 (larger than at 26) suggests the mid-20s generally show fertility increases, not specifically at the policy threshold. This reinforces that the "effect" reflects broad trends, not the insurance discontinuity.

### 4. Heterogeneity analysis is descriptive

**Response:** We acknowledge this in the text. The stratified analysis cannot identify causal effects because marital status is endogenous. However, the descriptive finding that *neither* group shows a discontinuity is informative - if insurance affected fertility, we would expect effects concentrated among unmarried women who experience the largest coverage drops.

### 5. Missing fuzzy RDD / IV discussion

**Response:** We have added Appendix A.5 with sensitivity analysis controlling for marriage. This shows that the discontinuity estimate drops 84% when marriage is controlled (from 0.50pp to 0.08pp) and loses statistical significance. While controlling for an endogenous variable is not causal, it demonstrates the sensitivity of results to compositional differences.

A formal fuzzy RDD treating marriage as an outcome of the first stage would face the same validity problem - the instrument (crossing age 26) affects marriage through channels other than insurance.

## Response to Minor Concerns

### 1. Contribution relative to Abramowitz (2016)

**Response:** We have added Appendix A.7 discussing this explicitly. Abramowitz used DID exploiting temporal variation; we use RDD exploiting cross-sectional variation. Both face different threats to validity. Our finding does not invalidate her estimates but suggests caution with age-based comparisons for life-course outcomes.

### 2. Bandwidth stability

**Response:** We note in Section 8.1 that the stability of estimates across bandwidths (2-5 years) is consistent with broad trends rather than local discontinuities. This supports the interpretation that the "effect" reflects smooth underlying patterns.

### 3. Title X changes

**Response:** We note in the limitations (Section 8.5) that the 2019 Title X rule changes may have affected contraception access, though this applies to only the final year of our sample period.

### 4. Power calculations

**Response:** We have added Appendix A.4 with formal power analysis. The study is well-powered to detect effects as small as 0.2 percentage points. The null findings in subgroup analysis are informative, not merely imprecise.

We believe these revisions substantially strengthen the paper by clarifying its methodological contribution and addressing the referee's concerns about interpretation. We thank the reviewers for pushing us to sharpen the framing.
