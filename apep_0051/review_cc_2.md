## Assessment of Revisions

The authors have made substantial revisions that address the major concerns from Round 1. The paper is now properly framed as a methodological contribution rather than a failed causal estimate.

### Revisions Successfully Addressed

1. **Reframing:** The new title, abstract, and introduction effectively position this as a methodological paper. The contribution is now clear: demonstrating when RDD validity fails and why balance tests should be treated as hard constraints.

2. **Overpowering discussion:** Section 8.1 thoughtfully addresses the statistical vs. economic significance concern. The point that even "small" imbalances can drive results when covariates strongly predict outcomes is well-made.

3. **Power analysis:** The appendix now includes formal power calculations showing the study is well-powered. This addresses the concern that null subgroup findings might reflect insufficient power.

4. **Marriage controls:** The sensitivity analysis showing an 84% reduction in the estimate when controlling for marriage is compelling evidence of compositional confounding.

5. **Abramowitz comparison:** The new appendix section clarifies the contribution relative to prior work.

## Remaining Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **Figure quality:** The figures are functional but could be improved. Figure 3 (marriage balance test failure) should more prominently display the discontinuity. Consider adding a horizontal line showing the magnitude of the jump.

2. **Conclusion brevity:** The conclusion could better summarize the methodological lesson. Consider adding a clear "takeaway" for applied researchers.

3. **Keywords update:** The keywords should reflect the methodological focus. Consider adding "validity testing" and "balance tests."

### Suggestions (Non-Essential)

1. The placebo figure (Figure 5) could show all estimates in a single coefficient plot rather than a table format.

2. Consider adding a "checklist" summary for applied researchers using age-based RDDs.

## Verdict: **Minor Revision**

The paper has improved substantially. The remaining issues are minor and can be addressed with targeted edits. The methodological contribution is now clear and well-supported. After addressing the minor issues above, the paper will be ready for external review.

## Editor's Summary

The authors have responded constructively to referee feedback. The reframing successfully transforms this from a "failed study" to a "useful methodological lesson." The addition of power analysis and sensitivity analysis strengthens the interpretation of null findings.

The paper now makes a clear contribution: demonstrating that age-based RDD thresholds can fail validity tests for life-course outcomes, and that balance tests should be treated as binding constraints rather than supplementary diagnostics.

Recommended for external review after minor revisions.
