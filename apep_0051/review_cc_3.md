## Assessment

The paper has addressed the concerns from Rounds 1 and 2. The revisions have substantially improved the framing, and the methodological contribution is now clear.

### Improvements Since Round 2

1. **Keywords updated:** Now includes "validity testing" and "balance tests" to reflect the methodological focus.

2. **Conclusion strengthened:** The new conclusion includes a clear "takeaway" and a practical checklist for applied researchers. This is exactly what the Round 2 review requested.

### Remaining Quality Assessment

**Structure:** Clear and logical. The paper moves from setup → validity tests → interpretation → lessons learned.

**Exposition:** The writing is accessible without sacrificing precision. Technical concepts (RDD assumptions, balance tests) are explained clearly.

**Figures:** Adequate for the purpose. Figure 3 (marriage discontinuity) clearly shows the balance test failure.

**Tables:** Well-formatted and informative. The power analysis and marriage-controlled sensitivity analysis add value.

**Contribution:** The methodological lesson---that age thresholds can fail for life-course outcomes---is clearly stated and well-supported.

### Minor Notes (Non-Essential)

1. The paper could cite more recent work on RDD validity testing (Cattaneo et al. 2020 is mentioned but could be expanded).

2. The checklist in the conclusion is useful but could be formatted as a numbered list with sub-bullets for clarity.

These are suggestions for further improvement, not requirements.

## Verdict: **Conditionally Accept**

The paper is ready for external review. The conditional aspects relate to minor formatting and presentation, which can be addressed after external feedback.

The paper makes a clear methodological contribution to the applied RDD literature. By demonstrating a case where standard validity tests fail, it provides a useful cautionary tale for researchers considering age-based discontinuities for life-course outcomes.
