## External Referee Reviews

| Reviewer | Decision | Key Concerns |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Reviewer 1 | REJECT AND RESUBMIT | Treatment heterogeneity, state-mean outcome dilution, limited power |
| Reviewer 2 | REJECT AND RESUBMIT | Policy coding, bundled states limited post-treatment, outcome aggregation |
| Reviewer 3 | MAJOR REVISION | Identification concerns, pretrend test marginal |

## Decision

**REJECT AND RESUBMIT** (Consensus)

Conservative score reflects substantive concerns about:
1. Small sample of bundled reform states (N=3 evaluable)
2. State mean NAEP outcome may dilute targeted effects
3. COVID disruption in 2022 NAEP
4. Pretrend test shows some concern (p=0.015)

## Key Findings

- Pooled ATT: 1.02 NAEP points (SE: 1.16) - precisely estimated null
- Bundled reform states (MS, FL, TN): 3.2 points (SE: 2.1) - suggestive positive
- Dyslexia-only states: 0.68 points (SE: 0.86) - null
- Placebo tests pass (Grade 4 Math, Grade 8 Reading)

## Methodological Notes

- Uses Callaway-Sant'Anna (2021) staggered DiD
- Treatment timing corrected for NAEP administration (Jan-Mar)
- Texas excluded (always-treated since 1995)
- 2022 adopters coded as never-treated (no post-treatment NAEP)
- 1000 bootstrap iterations, state-clustered standard errors
