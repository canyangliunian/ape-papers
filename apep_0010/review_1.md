## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥25 pages excl. refs/appendix): FAIL**  
   - The provided manuscript appears to be ~8 pages total (it ends on page “8” in the excerpt). This is far below the 25-page minimum.

2. **References (≥15 citations in bibliography): FAIL**  
   - Bibliography contains **4** entries (DOL 2021; Imbens & Kalyanaraman 2012; Lee & Lemieux 2010; McCrary 2008). This is below 15 (and below the “under 10 = FAIL” rule).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion): FAIL**  
   - Multiple sections use bullet lists rather than paragraph prose, notably **Section 2 (Background)** and **Section 6 (Discussion)** (and also Data/Variables presentation). This violates the “complete paragraphs” requirement.

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs): FAIL**  
   - Several major sections are too thin and/or structured as lists rather than developed paragraphs. In the excerpt:  
     - **Data (Section 4)** is largely subsections with short text + lists.  
     - **Results (Section 5)** is mostly table narration with limited multi-paragraph development.  
     - **Conclusion (Section 7)** is ~1 short paragraph.  
   - Under the stated rule, at least one major section fails the “3–4 substantive paragraphs” threshold.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data): FAIL**  
   - The paper references **“Figure ??”** (“Figure ?? presents the key evidence.”) but no figure is shown and the numbering is broken. Under the rule, missing/broken figures are a FAIL.

6. **Tables (real numbers, no placeholders): PASS**  
   - Tables 1–4 contain numeric values and Ns; no “XXX/TBD” placeholders are visible.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1. Expand the paper to **≥25 pages** (excluding references/appendix), with fuller literature review, methods/inference details, robustness, and discussion.
2. Expand the bibliography to **≥15 references** (currently 4).
3. Convert bullet-point sections (especially Background and Discussion, and any other major sections) into **full paragraph prose**.
4. Ensure **each major section** (Introduction, Literature, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion) has **3–4 substantive paragraphs** (not just short sub-bullets).
5. Insert and correctly render all figures; fix the broken reference **“Figure ??”** and ensure each figure is present, labeled, and displays actual data.

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2 (content review)** until these format issues are resolved.
