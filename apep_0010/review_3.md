## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - From the page markers in the excerpt: main text appears to run from p.1 (title/abstract) through p.24 (end of conclusion), with **References starting on p.25**. That implies **~24 pages of non-reference content**, which is **below 25**.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
   - The bibliography lists **~21 references** (Angrist & Lavy through Thistlethwaite & Campbell).

3. **Prose Quality (no bullet-point sections in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **PASS**  
   - The Introduction, Literature Review, Results, and Discussion are written in paragraph form (no bullet lists observed).

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has ≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **PASS**  
   - Introduction: multiple substantive paragraphs.  
   - Literature: multiple paragraphs across 2.1–2.3.  
   - Data: multiple paragraphs across 5.1–5.4 (meets threshold).  
   - Methods/Identification: multiple paragraphs across 4.1–4.3.  
   - Results: multiple subsections with explanatory paragraphs.  
   - Conclusion: multiple paragraphs across 8.1–8.5.

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data / not broken)**: **PASS**  
   - Figure 1 is present with axes and plotted series; nothing in the excerpt indicates an empty/broken figure.

6. **Tables (no placeholders; real numbers)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables 1–4 report numeric values (no “TBD/XXX” placeholders).

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Must-fix format issue(s)
- **Paper length is short of the requirement**: Expand the **main text** (excluding references/appendix) to **at least 25 pages**.  
  - As currently formatted, it appears to be **~24 pages** before the references begin.

Per your instructions, I am **not proceeding to Phase 2 (content review)** until the format issue above is resolved.
