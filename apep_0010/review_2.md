## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1) **Length (≥ 25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
- The document appears to run to ~25 pages *including* references (main text ends around p. 22; references start around p. 23). That implies ~22 pages of main text, which is below the ≥25-page requirement excluding references.

2) **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **PASS**  
- The bibliography lists ~21 references (well above 15).

3) **Prose Quality (complete paragraphs; no bullet-point sections in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **PASS**  
- The provided Introduction, Literature Review, Results, and Discussion are written in paragraph form, not bullet points.

4) **Section Completeness (each major section has ≥ 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **FAIL**  
- **Conclusion (Section 8)** is only ~2 substantive paragraphs in the excerpt, which violates the 3–4 paragraph minimum for a major section.

5) **Figures (all figures contain visible data; not empty/broken)**: **PASS (based on provided text/figure rendering)**  
- Figure 1 shows plotted points and axes with sensible ranges; it does not appear empty or broken.

6) **Tables (all tables have real numbers, not placeholders)**: **PASS**  
- Tables 1–4 contain numeric entries; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders are present.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
1) **Main-text length is too short** relative to the requirement (≥25 pages excluding references/appendix). You likely need **~3+ additional pages of main text**, not counting references.  
2) **Conclusion section is underdeveloped** (needs **at least 3–4 substantive paragraphs**). Consider expanding with: (i) sharper summary of identification and estimand (ITT vs TOT), (ii) interpretation of null in terms of power/MDE, (iii) policy implications with quantified back-of-envelope effects, (iv) concrete roadmap for future work/data that could estimate TOT.

Per your instructions, I will **not** proceed to Phase 2 until these are addressed.
