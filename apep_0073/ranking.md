# Idea Ranking

## Ranking Method
Manual evaluation based on APEP criteria (Novelty 40%, Identification 30%, Feasibility 20%, Relevance 10%)

## Idea 1: SNAP Work Requirement Reinstatement and Employment Outcomes

**Verdict: PURSUE**

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Novelty (40%) | 7/10 | SNAP work requirements studied for participation but employment outcomes less explored with modern DiD methods |
| Identification (30%) | 8/10 | Staggered waiver reinstatement provides clean state×time variation; waiver eligibility based on unemployment threshold |
| Feasibility (20%) | 9/10 | Census ACS PUMS API accessible, USDA FNS publishes waiver status, large samples |
| Relevance (10%) | 9/10 | Highly policy-relevant: work requirements are central to safety net reform debates |

**Weighted Score: 7.7/10**

## Idea 2: Age Group Heterogeneity
**Verdict: CONSIDER** - Valuable extension but derivative of Idea 1

## Idea 3: Self-Employment
**Verdict: SKIP** - Underpowered due to low base rate of self-employment

## Decision
Proceeding with **Idea 1: SNAP Work Requirement Reinstatement and Employment Outcomes**
