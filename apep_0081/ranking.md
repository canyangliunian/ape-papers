# Idea Ranking Summary

## Paper 108: Descriptive Data Paper

### Ranking Results

| Rank | Idea | Score | Recommendation |
|------|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Geocoded Atlas of US Traffic Fatalities | 9.2/10 | **PROCEED** |
| 2 | Spatial RDD at Marijuana Borders | 7.5/10 | Future work |
| 3 | THC-Alcohol Substitution Analysis | 7.0/10 | Future work |

### Selected Idea: Geocoded Atlas of US Traffic Fatalities

**Strengths:**
1. Novel contribution - first comprehensive FARS + OSM integration
2. High data availability - all sources publicly accessible
3. Foundation for future causal research
4. Publication-quality visualizations demonstrating granularity
5. Replication code enables community extension

**Weaknesses:**
1. Descriptive only - no causal claims
2. THC testing data limited to recent years (2018+)
3. Drug testing selection is a limitation

**Recommendation:** Proceed with data paper. The integrated dataset and visualizations provide substantial value to the research community. Causal analysis can follow in subsequent papers.

### Ranking Methodology

Ideas were evaluated on:
- Data feasibility (availability, sample size)
- Methodological rigor
- Policy relevance
- Novelty of contribution
- Publication potential

The data paper was selected because it maximizes the value of the novel FARS + OSM integration while honestly documenting data limitations that would complicate causal claims.
