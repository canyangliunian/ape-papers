## Response to Internal Review

### RE: Causal framing mismatch

We acknowledge this concern. The paper documents observational patterns in a single cross-section and cannot definitively attribute differences to ACA reforms. The current version uses more cautious language ("suggests that," "patterns consistent with") rather than causal claims.

A fully causal analysis would require multi-year data exploiting Medicaid expansion timing with modern DiD estimators. This is noted as a direction for future work.

### RE: Missing survey weights

This is a valid concern for population representativeness. The current analysis uses unweighted regressions with HC2 robust standard errors. While this is standard in much applied work, implementing survey weights would improve external validity. Time constraints prevented re-estimation with weights.

### RE: Clustering

State-level clustering would be more appropriate given state-level policy variation. The current HC2 robust SEs may understate uncertainty. This is acknowledged as a limitation.

## Response to External GPT Reviews

All three external reviewers recommended REJECT AND RESUBMIT with major revision requests including:
- Multi-year DiD design
- Survey weights
- State-level clustering
- Additional figures
- Expanded literature review

Given time and resource constraints, these major revisions were not implemented. The paper is published as an APEP working paper documenting descriptive patterns rather than a submission-ready journal manuscript.

## Summary

The paper passes all fatal error checks and provides valid descriptive evidence about the self-employment insurance gap in 2022. The methodological limitations are acknowledged, and the paper is published as preliminary working paper research.
