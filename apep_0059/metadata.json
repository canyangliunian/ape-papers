  "abstract": "Does self-employment reduce health insurance coverage compared to traditional wage employment in the post-Affordable Care Act era? Using data on 1.3 million workers from the 2022 American Community Survey, I estimate that self-employed workers are 6.1 percentage points less likely to have any health insurance coverage compared to observationally similar wage workers. This coverage deficit operates through dramatically lower employer-sponsored insurance rates (27.2 pp), partially offset by higher direct-purchase coverage (18.3 pp) and Medicaid enrollment (3.2 pp). The coverage gap is substantially smaller in Medicaid expansion states (6.4 pp vs. 10.1 pp). The gap is smallest for lowest-income workers (1.6 pp) who qualify for Medicaid and highest-income workers (4.6 pp), while middle-income workers face the largest penalty (9.5 pp).",
