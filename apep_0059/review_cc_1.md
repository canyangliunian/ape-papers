# Internal Review - Round 1

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Date:** 2026-01-25

## Summary

This paper examines the health insurance coverage gap between self-employed and wage workers using 2022 ACS data. The main finding is that self-employed workers are 6.1 percentage points less likely to have any health insurance than comparable wage workers.

## Strengths

1. Large, representative sample (1.3M observations)
2. Clear variable definitions and transparent methodology
3. Useful heterogeneity analysis by Medicaid expansion and income
4. Appropriate acknowledgment of observational limitations

## Issues Identified

### Major Issues

1. **Causal framing mismatch**: The paper frames itself as evaluating ACA effectiveness but uses a single-year cross-section that cannot support causal claims
2. **Missing survey weights**: ACS PUMS requires person weights for population-representative estimates
3. **Clustering**: Standard errors should be clustered at the state level given state-level policy variation

### Minor Issues

1. Missing figures - coefficient plots and heterogeneity visualizations would strengthen presentation
2. Limited literature coverage - needs more ACA/Medicaid expansion citations
3. Paper is relatively short for a top-journal submission

## Verdict

MAJOR REVISION - The descriptive patterns are interesting and well-documented, but the causal framing needs to be toned down significantly given the observational design. The paper would benefit from:
- Reframing as a descriptive analysis
- Adding survey weights
- Adding figures
- Expanding literature review
