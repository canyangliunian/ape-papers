## Setup Results

- **Domain:** Health & Traffic Safety (Cannabis-alcohol substitution)
- **Method:** SpatialRDD at state borders
- **Data era:** Modern (2016-2019)
- **Risk appetite:** Novel angle (classic policy + new visual/method approach)
- **Other preferences:**
  - Inspired by apep_0106 "The Price of Distance" concept
  - Focus on beautiful maps with road networks
  - Scatter plots with non-parametric regression (loess/local polynomial)
  - SpatialRDD as main identification strategy
  - RDD graphs with confidence intervals
  - Strong conceptual framework and economic model
  - Mechanism tests
  - Even null effects are valuable

## Inspiration Paper

Parent concept from apep_0106 (refactor/claude-md-game-tree branch):
- Title: "The Price of Distance: Cannabis Dispensary Access and the Composition of Fatal Crashes"
- Core idea: Distance/driving time to legal dispensaries affects alcohol involvement in crashes
- Weakness: Poor visual execution, no SpatialRDD, weak maps
- Improvement plan: Geographic discontinuity at state borders + visual storytelling
