## Review Summary

This is a follow-up review after addressing Round 1 concerns. The paper has been revised to fix numerical inconsistencies and add several new analyses.

### Changes Since Round 1

1. **Numerical consistency:** All reported values (coefficient 0.82, AR CI [0.51, 1.15], F=556, prob-weighted 0.28) are now internally consistent across abstract, introduction, tables, results text, and conclusion.

2. **New analyses added:**
   - Placebo shock tests (GDP and employment instruments) -- both null, supporting exclusion restriction
   - Joint state exclusion (CA+NY: beta=0.80; CA+NY+WA: beta=0.82) -- results robust
   - COVID interaction specification -- pre-COVID coefficient larger (1.08), interaction negative
   - Differential-trend test for balance
   - Origin-state clustering (Borusyak et al.) in inference table

3. **New literature:** Sun & Abraham, de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfouille, Kramarz & Skandalis, Bleemer, Mincer, Belot & Van den Berg all properly cited.

4. **Industry heterogeneity:** Appropriately framed as future direction given data limitations.

### Remaining Issues (Non-Fatal)

1. **Figure 2 label:** May still show F=551 rather than F=556 in the figure itself. Minor visual issue.
2. **Pre-period evidence:** Still thin (2 pre-periods) but honestly discussed with Rambachan-Roth sensitivity.
3. **Table 4 vs Figure 7 Q1/Q4 ordering:** Labels may appear inverted between table and figure (Gemini flagged). Worth checking but may be a visual rendering artifact.

### Assessment

The paper is substantially improved. All fatal errors from the initial advisor review have been addressed. The numerical reporting is now internally consistent. New robustness analyses (placebo shocks, joint exclusion) substantially strengthen the identification argument.

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
