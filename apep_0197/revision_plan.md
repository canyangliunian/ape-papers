# Revision Plan (Post-External Review)

## Reviewer Consensus
- 2012 pre-trend coefficient (~1.4) is a concern (all 3)
- Industry heterogeneity needed but data-limited (all 3)
- Earnings mechanism is noisy (all 3)
- SCI timing sensitivity (GPT, Gemini)

## Actions

### 1. Strengthen pre-trend discussion
- Already honestly report the 2012 coefficient
- Add: explicit joint F-test for pre-period coefficients
- Add: note that QWI starts 2012Q1, limiting pre-period evidence

### 2. Industry heterogeneity
- Already framed as future direction (no industry-level QWI)
- No action needed -- data limitation is real

### 3. Earnings mechanism
- Already reported as noisy in text
- Add: brief discussion of why county-level earnings may not respond (composition effects, min wage workers are small share)

### 4. SCI timing sensitivity
- Add: brief note that SCI reflects long-run social connections (historical migration), not contemporaneous flows
- Reference Bailey et al. (2018) showing SCI stability

### 5. Missing citations
- Calvo-Armengol & Jackson (2007) -- already in bibliography as calvoarmengol2004
- Mortensen (2003) -- add if relevant
- Hagedorn et al. (2017) -- UI spillovers, adjacent literature

## Non-actions (addressed or infeasible)
- Longer pre-period: QWI starts 2012Q1, cannot extend
- Formal R&R sensitivity plots: already referenced, formal implementation beyond scope
- 2010 Census weights: would require re-running entire pipeline with alternative shares
