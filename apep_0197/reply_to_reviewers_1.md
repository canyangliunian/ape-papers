## Reviewer 1 (GPT-5-mini): MAJOR REVISION

**1. Instrument exclusion validity**
We added placebo shock tests showing GDP-weighted and employment-weighted instruments are null (p>0.10 for both), directly supporting the exclusion restriction (Section 10.6). Distance-restricted instruments with improved balance (Table 5) further address this concern.

**2. SCI timing (2018 vintage)**
We added a dedicated discussion in Section 11.5 noting that SCI reflects long-run connections (Bailey et al. 2018), our shift-share framework treats SCI as pre-determined shares (Borusyak et al. 2022), and our IRS migration analysis finds no endogenous migration response.

**3. Pre-trend evidence**
We expanded the pre-trend sensitivity discussion (Section 10.7) to honestly acknowledge the limited pre-period (QWI begins 2012Q1) and the non-trivial 2012 coefficient. We note that our confidence rests on three complementary pieces of evidence: placebo shocks, distance-restricted instruments, and AR confidence sets.

**4. Shock contribution transparency**
Table 7 reports shock contributions with HHI=0.08 (effective N~12 shocks). Joint state exclusion (Section 10.5) shows stability when removing CA+NY jointly and CA+NY+WA jointly.

**5. Mechanism evidence**
We acknowledge earnings results are noisy and add a discussion in Section 11.5 explaining composition effects: if network information brings more low-wage workers into employment, average county earnings may not rise.

## Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): MINOR REVISION

**1. Pre-trend in 2012**
Addressed in expanded Section 10.7 discussion. QWI limitations prevent longer pre-period.

**2. Levels imbalance**
Addressed with differential-trend test in Section 10.4 (balance test discussion). County FEs absorb level differences mechanically.

**3. COVID interaction**
Section 10.4 now reports full COVID interaction specification: pre-COVID coefficient (0.71), negative interaction (-0.095, p=0.11).

**4. Industry heterogeneity**
Section 11.2 discusses this as a prediction of the theoretical framework. Aggregate QWI data cannot test this; we frame it as future research.

## Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash): MAJOR REVISION

**1. 2012 pre-trend**
See response to Reviewer 1, point 3.

**2. Earnings mechanism**
New discussion in Section 11.5 explains why county-level earnings may not respond (composition effects on extensive margin).

**3. GE magnitude**
Section 11.1 provides calibration against Moretti (2011) local multipliers and labor supply elasticity decomposition (individual elasticity 0.1-0.3 × amplification 3-8x = 0.3-2.4, encompassing our 0.82).

**4. Search theory citations**
Calvo-Armengol & Jackson (2004) is already cited. We note this as primarily an empirical paper; formal search-theoretic microfoundations are beyond scope.

**5. SCI timing**
See response to Reviewer 1, point 2.
