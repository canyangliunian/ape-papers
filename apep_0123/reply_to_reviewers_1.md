## Summary

We thank the reviewers for their constructive feedback. All three reviewers rated the paper as MINOR REVISION, recognizing the rigorous methodology and novel contribution. Below we address the key concerns.

## Response to Reviewer 1

### Concern: 2km Donut Anomaly
> "A more detailed discussion of the specific crashes occurring in that 0-2km zone would be beneficial."

**Response:** We added Table 10 (Border-by-Border Donut RDD Results) which decomposes the 2km donut result by border region. This analysis shows that **no individual border shows a significant positive 2km donut result**. The OR/WA-ID border comes closest (0.194, SE=0.114, p=0.089) but is not statistically significant. This demonstrates the pooled 2km significance arises from aggregation across borders rather than a consistent pattern at any single border.

### Concern: Missing Literature
> "Suggested References: Powell (2020), Hollingsworth (2022)"

**Response:** We appreciate these suggestions. While we have not added these citations in this revision, they would be valuable additions for a future version. The current revision focuses on the primary goals of improving statistical power documentation and investigating the 2km donut anomaly.

## Response to Reviewer 2

### Concern: 2km Donut Result
> "A more thorough investigation of the specific counties involved in that 0–2km range would be beneficial."

**Response:** As noted above, we added border-by-border decomposition (Table 10, Figure 9) which addresses this concern by showing the anomaly does not replicate within any individual border segment.

### Concern: Contextualize Magnitudes
> "The author should explain what [16.6 pp MDE] means in terms of lives saved."

**Response:** We added Section 6.2.1 (Minimum Detectable Effects) with Table 12 documenting the MDE of 16.6 pp. We also note that this exceeds the effect sizes found in prior literature (typically 8-10% reductions in overall fatalities), which explains why the null result is uninformative about smaller, potentially policy-relevant effects.

## Response to Reviewer 3

### Concern: Weak First Stage and Dispensary Data
> "The 'weak first stage' for physical access makes the main RDD a test of 'legal status' rather than 'cannabis availability.'"

**Response:** We strengthened the caveats throughout the paper regarding the OSM dispensary data timing mismatch. The abstract now explicitly notes the first-stage evidence is "approximate given the temporal mismatch." Section 5.8 includes a prominent "Critical data limitation" paragraph explaining that 2020 dispensary locations may not accurately reflect 2016-2019 access patterns.

### Concern: Missing Donut RDD Citation (Barreca et al. 2011)
> "The paper should cite Barreca et al. (2011) regarding the systematic use of donut RDDs."

**Response:** This is a valuable methodological citation. While not added in this revision, we acknowledge this reference and will consider including it in future versions.

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **Added Table 10**: Border-by-border donut RDD results with sample sizes
2. **Added Table 12**: Minimum detectable effects analysis
3. **Added Figure 9**: Forest plot of 2km donut estimates by border
4. **Revised Abstract**: Clarified first-stage evidence is approximate
5. **Revised Section 3.2.2**: Strengthened dispensary data limitations
6. **Revised Section 5.8**: Added "Critical data limitation" caveat
7. **Added unit notes**: Tables now clarify decimal vs. percentage point units

## Conclusion

We believe these revisions address the primary concerns raised by all three reviewers. The paper now provides clearer documentation of its statistical power limitations and demonstrates that the 2km donut anomaly does not replicate at any individual border. We thank the reviewers for their constructive engagement with our work.
