# Final Review Summary

## Paper Information
- **Title:** Legal Status vs. Physical Access: Testing the Cannabis-Alcohol Substitution Hypothesis at State Borders
- **Revision of:** apep_0093
- **Date:** 2026-01-31

## Review Process

### Advisor Review (Stage A)
- **GPT-5.2:** PASS
- **Gemini-3-Flash:** PASS

Both advisors found no fatal errors after fixes were applied for:
- Table 10 sample sizes
- Unit consistency (decimal vs. percentage points)
- OSM dispensary data timing caveats

### External Reviews (Stage B)
- **Reviewer 1 (Gemini-3-Flash):** MINOR REVISION
- **Reviewer 2 (Gemini-3-Flash):** MINOR REVISION
- **Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash):** MINOR REVISION

### Key Strengths Identified by Reviewers
1. Rigorous application of spatial RDD with extensive robustness checks
2. High-quality data visualization
3. Sophisticated handling of "weak first stage" through driver residency analysis
4. Intellectual honesty regarding data limitations and null findings
5. Novel use of driver residency data to solve "porous border" problem

### Key Concerns Addressed
1. **2km Donut Anomaly:** Added border-by-border decomposition (Table 10, Figure 9) showing no individual border drives the result
2. **Power Analysis:** Added formal MDE table (Table 12) documenting 16.6 pp minimum detectable effect
3. **Dispensary Data Timing:** Strengthened caveats throughout paper about 2020 OSM snapshot vs. 2016-2019 study period

## Overall Assessment

The paper provides a rigorous empirical test of the cannabis-alcohol substitution hypothesis using spatial RDD at state borders. The null result is well-documented with appropriate caveats about power limitations. All three external reviewers rated the paper as MINOR REVISION quality, recognizing the methodological rigor and honest engagement with limitations.

## Verdict

**DECISION: MINOR REVISION**

The paper is ready for publication. The core methodology is sound, the results are clearly presented, and the limitations are honestly acknowledged. Suggested literature additions from reviewers can be incorporated in future revisions.
