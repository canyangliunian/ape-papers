## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-5

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0093
**Parent Title:** Legal Status vs. Physical Access: Testing the Cannabis-Alcohol Substitution Hypothesis at State Borders
**Parent Decision:** MINOR REVISION (all 3 reviewers)
**Revision Rationale:** User requested improvements to statistical power, border-by-border investigation of 2km donut anomaly, and formal MDE analysis

## Key Changes Planned

1. **Border-by-Border Donut Analysis:** Decompose the 2km donut result (significant positive, 0.237 SE=0.082) by individual border segments to identify which border(s) drive the anomaly
2. **Formal Power Analysis:** Add MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect) table showing detection limits at 80% power across specifications
3. **Missing Citations:** Add Cattaneo et al. (2020), Hausman & Rapson (2018), Hao & Cowan (2020) per reviewer feedback

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **Reviewer 1:** Study underpowered for small effects → Adding formal MDE table
2. **Reviewer 2:** 2km donut needs deeper investigation → Border-by-border donut analysis
3. **Reviewer 3:** Missing RDD methodology citations → Adding Cattaneo et al. (2020), Hausman & Rapson (2018)

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Does cannabis access reduce alcohol involvement in fatal crashes?
- Identification strategy: Spatial RDD at legal-prohibition state borders
- Primary data source: FARS 2016-2019, OSM dispensary locations
- Sample: 29,350 geocoded fatal crashes in 13 western states
