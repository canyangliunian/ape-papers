# Revision Plan

## Summary of Reviewer Feedback

All three reviewers (Gemini-3-Flash) gave **MINOR REVISION**.

### Common Themes

1. **2km Donut Anomaly**: All reviewers noted the specification sensitivity with the 2km donut result. This was addressed in the revision through border-by-border decomposition (Table 10, Figure 9), which shows no individual border drives the anomaly.

2. **Weak First Stage**: Reviewers noted the limitation of using 2020 OSM dispensary data for a 2016-2019 study. This was addressed by adding prominent caveats in the abstract, Section 3.2.2, and Section 5.8, reframing the first-stage evidence as "suggestive" rather than definitive.

3. **Missing Literature**: Reviewers suggested additional citations (Powell 2020, Hollingsworth 2022, Baggio 2020, Wen 2015). These are valuable suggestions for future revisions.

4. **Prose Quality**: Minor concerns about bulleted lists in Data/Methods sections.

### Actions Taken in This Revision

1. Added border-by-border donut analysis (Table 10, Figure 9)
2. Added formal MDE/power analysis (Table 12)
3. Strengthened caveats about OSM dispensary data timing mismatch
4. Added unit conversion notes to tables (decimal vs. percentage points)
5. Added sample sizes to Table 10

### Actions Deferred (Minor Revision Quality)

1. Additional literature citations (can be added in future revision)
2. Converting some bulleted lists to prose (minor formatting)
3. VMT data analysis (data not readily available)

## Verdict

The paper addresses the primary revision goals (power analysis, 2km donut investigation) and all three reviewers rated it as MINOR REVISION quality. Ready for publication.
