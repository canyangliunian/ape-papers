# Research Plan: Divine Forgiveness Beliefs — A Comprehensive Cross-Cultural and Economic Analysis

## Research Question

How prevalent and varied are beliefs about divine forgiveness and punishment across human societies, and what economic and policy conditions correlate with these beliefs?

## Paper Structure

### Part 1: Descriptive Analysis (Primary Contribution)
The most comprehensive empirical documentation of divine forgiveness/punishment beliefs across:
- **Individual-level** (US): GSS items on experienced divine forgiveness (FORGIVE3), punishment (COPE4), God-images (JUDGE), afterlife beliefs (HELL, HEAVEN)
- **Cross-cultural society-level**: D-PLACE Ethnographic Atlas (1,291 societies), SCCS (186 societies), Pulotu (137 Austronesian cultures)
- **Historical polity-level**: Seshat moralizing supernatural punishment data

### Part 2: Correlational Analysis (Exploratory)
Correlations between divine forgiveness/punishment beliefs and:
- **Economic development** (GDP per capita, inequality)
- **Government policies** (social safety nets, rule of law, state capacity)
- **Demographic factors** (education, urbanization, age structure)
- **Geographic/ecological factors** (subsistence type, population density)

## Identification Strategy

This paper does NOT claim causal identification. It is explicitly descriptive and correlational. The contribution is:
1. First comprehensive documentation across multiple datasets and levels of analysis
2. Empirical patterns that generate hypotheses for future causal work
3. Appendix cataloging all known datasets (including restricted-access ones)

## Data Sources

### Primary (freely downloadable):
1. **GSS Cumulative** — Individual-level US data, FORGIVE3/COPE4/JUDGE/HELL/HEAVEN
2. **D-PLACE Ethnographic Atlas** — EA034 high gods variable, 1,291 societies
3. **D-PLACE SCCS** — 186 societies with high gods + extensive covariate coding
4. **Pulotu** — 137 Austronesian cultures, supernatural punishment for impiety
5. **Seshat** — Historical polities, moralizing supernatural punishment (this life/afterlife)

### Covariates for Part 2:
- SCCS environmental/economic variables (subsistence, population, stratification)
- FRED/World Bank economic indicators for cross-country correlations
- GSS demographic variables for individual-level correlations

## Expected Findings

1. **Descriptive**: Wide variation in divine punishment/forgiveness beliefs both across and within societies
2. **Correlational**: Economic development and state capacity negatively correlated with belief in punitive gods (consistent with "Big Gods" hypothesis)
3. **Individual-level**: Education, income, and urbanization negatively correlated with experienced divine punishment; positively with forgiveness framing
4. **Historical**: Moralizing supernatural punishment increases with polity complexity (Seshat patterns)

## Planned Analyses

### Part 1: Descriptive
- Cross-tabulations and distributions of all divine belief variables
- Maps/visualizations of geographic distribution
- Time trends (GSS: 1970s-2020s changes in US beliefs)
- Cross-dataset comparison of measurement approaches

### Part 2: Correlational
- OLS regressions with demographic controls (GSS individual-level)
- Cross-cultural correlations with ecological/economic variables (SCCS)
- Logistic regressions for binary belief outcomes
- Partial correlations controlling for religious tradition

## Robustness
- Multiple operationalizations of "divine forgiveness/punishment"
- Sensitivity to sample restrictions and variable coding
- Comparison across datasets where constructs overlap
