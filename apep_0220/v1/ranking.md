## Detailed Assessment

### Idea 1: Who Believes God Forgives?

**Novelty (40%):** 34/40 — High novelty. No prior study integrates all freely available divine belief datasets. The measurement documentation is a genuine public good. The cross-cultural + individual-level combination is original.

**Identification (30%):** 20/30 — Descriptive and correlational by design. The paper explicitly disclaims causal identification, which is appropriate for its contribution type. OLS correlates are well-specified with appropriate caveats.

**Feasibility (20%):** 18/20 — All data sources confirmed accessible. GSS, D-PLACE, Pulotu, and Seshat all download successfully via APIs/GitHub. FRED economic covariates available. No access barriers.

**Relevance (10%):** 10/10 — Directly relevant to economics of religion, cultural evolution, and political economy literatures. The four channels (risk preferences, social trust, institutional compliance, redistributive attitudes) are well-established in the literature.

**Overall:** PURSUE — This is a well-conceived descriptive contribution that fills a genuine gap in the literature. The human-directed topic choice ensures alignment with research priorities.

## Notes

This paper was human-directed: the user specified the topic, data sources (from deep-research-report-GODFORGIVING.md), and methodological approach (descriptive + correlational). The standard discovery/ranking pipeline was bypassed by design.
