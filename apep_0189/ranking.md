# Idea Ranking

## Selected Idea

**Population-Weighted Network Minimum Wage Exposure**

Score: 9.5/10

## Rationale

This idea builds on the existing apep_0188 paper with a key innovation: using population-weighted rather than probability-weighted exposure. This is theoretically motivated by the information transmission mechanism and has strong empirical support.
