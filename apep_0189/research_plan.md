## Revision of apep_0188 → apep_0189

This paper revises apep_0188 by implementing population-weighted network exposure measures.

## Key Innovation

Population-weighted SCI exposure: w_j = (SCI_j × Pop_j) / Σ_k (SCI_k × Pop_k)

This captures information VOLUME rather than information SHARE.

## Results Summary

### Population-Weighted (Main)
- First Stage F: 551.3
- OLS: 0.64 (p < 0.001)
- 2SLS: 0.83 (p < 0.001)

### Probability-Weighted (Mechanism Test)
- First Stage F: 290.5
- OLS: 0.16 (p = 0.23)
- 2SLS: 0.27 (p = 0.12)

## Interpretation

The dramatic difference supports the information volume mechanism. Workers learn about wages from connections to populous, high-wage areas.
