I have reviewed the draft paper "Information Volume Matters: Causal Evidence on Network Transmission of Minimum Wage Effects" for fatal errors. 

No fatal errors were found in the categories of Data-Design Alignment, Regression Sanity, Completeness, or Internal Consistency. The data coverage (2012–2022) is consistent with the treatment variation described, the regression coefficients and standard errors are within plausible ranges for log-log and log-level specifications in labor economics, and the tables are complete with necessary sample sizes and clustering information.

**ADVISOR VERDICT: PASS**
