# Initial Research Plan

## Revision of apep_0188

This paper revises apep_0188 by implementing population-weighted network exposure measures.

## Key Changes

1. **Exposure measure:** Weight SCI by destination population (employment)
2. **Mechanism test:** Compare population-weighted vs probability-weighted
3. **Framing:** Emphasize information volume mechanism

## Expected Results

- Stronger first stage with population-weighted measure
- Significant 2SLS estimates with population-weighted
- Insignificant 2SLS estimates with probability-weighted

## Timeline

1. Implement population-weighted exposure
2. Run main analysis with both measures
3. Run robustness checks
4. Write paper
5. Run reviews
