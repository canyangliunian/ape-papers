# Revision Plan - Stage C

## Consolidated Feedback Summary

### All 3 reviewers request:
1. **Earnings/wage 2SLS analysis** - Currently only employment outcome; theory predicts wage changes
2. **Additional mechanism evidence** - Industry heterogeneity (low-wage sectors)

### GPT-5-mini specific (MAJOR):
3. Shock-level clustering (Borusyak-style origin-state clustering)
4. IV event study (dynamic 2SLS, not just OLS)
5. Full shock contribution table with SEs
6. Alternative instruments (exclude CA+NY)
7. SCI vintage sensitivity
8. Missing references (Callaway & Sant'Anna, Conley)
9. Complier characterization

### Grok specific (MINOR):
10. Convert theory lists to prose
11. Add Callaway & Sant'Anna, Sun & Abraham references
12. Trim institutional section

### Gemini specific (MINOR):
13. Industry-level heterogeneity (NAICS)
14. Housing costs check

## Actions for This Revision

**High priority (address now):**
- Add earnings/wage 2SLS results to paper (mention in Discussion)
- Add missing references (Callaway & Sant'Anna)
- Convert theory numbered lists to prose
- Add note about shock-level clustering in inference section

**Deferred (note for future revision):**
- Industry heterogeneity requires NAICS-level QWI (data constraint)
- SCI vintage sensitivity (only one vintage available)
- Housing costs analysis (additional data source)
- Full complier characterization
