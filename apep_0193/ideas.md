## Idea 1: Population-Weighted Network Minimum Wage Exposure (SELECTED)

**Question:** Does population-weighted network exposure to minimum wages affect local employment?

**Hypothesis:** Information volume matters - the absolute number of connections to high-MW areas should matter more than the share of network in high-MW areas.

**Data:** Facebook SCI, QWI employment, state minimum wages 2012-2022

**Identification:** Out-of-state IV with state×time FE

**Feasibility:** High - builds on existing apep_0188 infrastructure

## Idea 2: Migration-Based Exposure (Alternative)

Could use IRS migration data instead of SCI.

## Idea 3: Industry-Specific Exposure (Extension)

Could examine effects by industry (high-bite vs low-bite).
