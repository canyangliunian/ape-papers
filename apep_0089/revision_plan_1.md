# Revision Plan

Based on reviewer feedback, the following improvements would strengthen the paper for a top-tier journal submission:

## Priority 1: Data Enhancement
- Supplement NAICS 6211 data with BLS OEWS (Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics) to disaggregate physician vs. support staff employment
- This addresses the main concern that current data cannot distinguish between physician and medical assistant employment

## Priority 2: Mechanism Exploration
- Analyze number of establishments as additional outcome to distinguish between practice closures vs. staffing reductions
- Explore heterogeneity by urban/rural status and baseline NP supply

## Priority 3: Literature Expansion
- Add McMichael (2020) on labor market effects of NP SOP
- Engage with broader DiD methodology literature (Cunningham, Borusyak et al.)
- Cite recent work on NP-physician competition

## Priority 4: Statistical Robustness
- Add wild cluster bootstrap given small number of treated states
- Report permutation-based p-values

## For Current Submission
The paper is published as-is for APEP working paper purposes, acknowledging the marginal significance (p=0.09) and data limitations as appropriate for a field-journal quality contribution.
