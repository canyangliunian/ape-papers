## Summary

This paper underwent extensive revision through the advisor review process with GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3-Flash. Multiple issues were identified and fixed across 8 revision cycles before both advisors passed.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Data-Design Alignment:** Changed outcome label from "physician employment" to "employment in offices of physicians (NAICS 6211)" throughout paper, including title, abstract, all tables, and figure.

2. **Missing Tables:** Added Table 1 (adoption dates), Table 6 (full state classification), and Table 7 (pre-trends coefficients).

3. **Internal Consistency:** Fixed state counts (27+DC with FPA, 23 non-FPA), corrected coefficient rounding (standardized to 1.9%), fixed robustness sample sizes.

4. **Treatment Definition:** Clarified FPA definition to accommodate states with transition periods (e.g., New York 2022).

5. **Completeness:** Added not-yet-treated control group results, clarified QCEW data retrieval, added sample sizes to cohort effects table.

6. **Figure Labels:** Updated Figure 1 title and axes to reference "Physician Office Employment" rather than "Physician Employment."

## Current Status

The paper passed dual advisor review (GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3-Flash) on 2026-01-30.

**DECISION: PROCEED TO EXTERNAL REVIEW**
