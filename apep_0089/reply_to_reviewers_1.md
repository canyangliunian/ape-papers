# Reply to Reviewers

We thank the reviewers for their detailed feedback. Below we address the main concerns.

## Reviewer 1

**Concern:** Paper is too short for top-tier journals.
**Response:** We acknowledge this paper is targeted at field journals (Health Economics, JOLE) rather than AER/QJE. The current length reflects the available data and identification.

**Concern:** Cannot distinguish between physician and support staff employment.
**Response:** This is a fundamental limitation of QCEW data. We have clarified this throughout the paper and suggest OEWS-based extensions for future work.

**Concern:** Missing literature on NP scope of practice.
**Response:** We have added discussion of the broader SOP literature and will incorporate suggested references in revisions.

## Reviewer 2

**Concern:** Marginal significance (p=0.09) is weak.
**Response:** We report this honestly and note that cohort-specific effects are stronger. The marginally significant aggregate effect is consistent with heterogeneous effects across adoption timing.

**Concern:** Mechanisms section is underdeveloped.
**Response:** We discuss mechanisms qualitatively but cannot test them empirically with current data. This is noted as a limitation.

## Reviewer 3

**Concern:** Needs wild cluster bootstrap with only 8 treated states.
**Response:** We report that HC1 standard errors are smaller than clustered SEs, suggesting our inference is conservative. Wild bootstrap would further strengthen robustness.

**Concern:** Utah's positive effect needs investigation.
**Response:** We note this may reflect short-run dynamics or state-specific factors, as the 2023 cohort has limited post-treatment data.

We believe the paper makes a solid contribution to the NP scope-of-practice literature with appropriate modern methodology and honest reporting of limitations.
