## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1. **Length (≥ 25 pages, excl. refs/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
   - The manuscript appears to be ~8 pages total (ends at p. 8). This is far below 25 pages.

2. **References (≥ 15 citations in bibliography)**: **FAIL**  
   - The bibliography lists **2** references (Cengiz et al. 2019; Dube 2019), far below 15.

3. **Prose Quality (complete paragraphs; no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **FAIL**  
   - The **Introduction** includes a numbered/bulleted list of “My main findings are:” (items 1–3). That violates the “all text in complete paragraphs” requirement.

4. **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **FAIL**  
   - **Introduction**: mostly brief + a bullet list; does not reach 3–4 substantive paragraphs.  
   - **Literature**: effectively only a passing mention (Cengiz/Dube) rather than a dedicated, multi-paragraph literature review.  
   - **Data**: ~1–2 short paragraphs + a table; not 3–4 substantive paragraphs.  
   - **Methods/Empirical Strategy**: very short (largely one equation + brief description).  
   - **Results**: short subsections with limited interpretation; not 3–4 substantive paragraphs in a full Results section.  
   - **Conclusion**: brief (≈1 paragraph).

5. **Figures (all figures contain visible data; none broken/empty)**: **PASS** (by inspection)  
   - No figures are included in the provided manuscript excerpt, so there are none to be “empty/broken.”

6. **Tables (real numbers; no placeholders like XXX/TBD)**: **PASS**  
   - Tables shown (Tables 1–5) contain numeric values (no obvious placeholders such as “TBD/XXX”).

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before content review
- **Expand to ≥ 25 pages** (excluding references/appendix). The current draft (~8 pages) is far too short for an academic economics paper.
- **Expand the bibliography to ≥ 15 references** and integrate them into a real literature review section.
- **Remove bullet/numbered finding lists** (at least in Introduction/Results/Discussion) and convert to fully developed prose paragraphs.
- **Develop each major section to 3–4 substantive paragraphs minimum**:
  - A genuine **Literature Review** (theory + empirical; minimum wage DiD/event-study; TWFE issues; ACS measurement)
  - A fuller **Data** section (sample construction, wage construction details, trimming/winsorizing, weighting, missing 2020 implications, etc.)
  - A fuller **Methods** section (identification assumptions, event-study specification, inference/clustering, threats/robustness)
  - A fuller **Results** section (main estimates with SEs/CIs, event-study plots or tables across all post years, robustness checks)
  - A fuller **Conclusion/Discussion** (limitations, external validity, mechanisms, policy implications, sensitivity)

Per your instructions, I will **not** proceed to Phase 2 (content review) until these format issues are addressed.
