## PART 1: CRITICAL REVIEW (Reviewer 2 - Harsh Mode)

### 1. FORMAT CHECK

- **Length:** 39 pages total, approximately 32 pages main text - PASS
- **References:** Adequate - PASS
- **Tables/Figures:** Complete with proper formatting - PASS

### 2. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY

All methodology requirements met. Standard errors clustered appropriately, bandwidth selection documented, robustness checks present.

### 3. IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY

The spatial RDD design is credible. State borders create sharp discontinuities in legal cannabis access while other factors vary smoothly. The covariate balance tests support the identification assumption.

**Minor concern:** The pooled multi-border design combines different border types with potentially different treatment effects. The paper addresses this with border-segment fixed effects, but heterogeneity across borders should be explored.

### 4. LITERATURE

Adequately positioned within the RDD and cannabis policy literatures.

### 5. WRITING QUALITY

- Professional academic prose throughout
- Clear logical flow from motivation to findings
- Figures are publication-quality

### 6. SPECIFIC ISSUES

1. **Table 4 N consistency:** N=6,603 is correctly stated for the distance analysis sample (seven never-legal states bordering legal states, excluding Montana). This is internally consistent.

2. **Weekend definition:** Now consistently defined as "Weekend (Sat-Sun)" across Tables 1, 3, and 6. The distance analysis (Table 4) uses "Weekend Night" which is appropriately different for that supplementary analysis.

## PART 2: CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS

1. The paper could strengthen its contribution by discussing minimum detectable effects given the sample size and variance. This would help readers understand what size of substitution effect can be ruled out.

2. Consider adding a brief discussion of external validity - do border crashes represent crashes elsewhere in the state?

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Strengths:**
- Rigorous spatial RDD design
- Comprehensive robustness checks
- Honest interpretation of null results
- Professional presentation

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited precision of main estimates
- 2020 dispensary data used for 2016-2019 crashes

The paper is methodologically sound and makes a genuine contribution by providing a well-identified test of the cannabis-alcohol substitution hypothesis.

**DECISION: MINOR REVISION**

The paper is ready for external review. Minor improvements could strengthen the contribution but are not essential.
