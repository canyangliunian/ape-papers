## Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. Honest reporting of null/negative findings
2. Thorough discussion of parallel trends violations
3. Clear acknowledgment that this design cannot provide clean identification
4. Appropriate policy recommendations (bans still supported by psychological evidence)

**Weaknesses (Acknowledged in Paper):**
1. Likely parallel trends violations
2. Few clusters for inference
3. Birth state ≠ school state
4. Cannot control for correlated reforms

These are inherent to the research question and data limitations, not paper quality issues.
