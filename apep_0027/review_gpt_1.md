## PHASE 1: FORMAT REVIEW

1) **Length (≥25 pages excluding references/appendix)**: **FAIL**  
- The manuscript appears to run to **~17 pages of main text** (pp. 1–17), with **references on p. 18** and **figures on pp. 19–20**. This is **well under 25 pages** of main text.

2) **References (≥15 citations in bibliography)**: **FAIL**  
- The bibliography lists **8 references** (Cameron et al. 2008; Bacher-Hicks et al. 2019; Gershoff 2002; Gershoff et al. 2010; Gershoff & Font 2017; Losen et al. 2015; School Discipline Support Initiative 2016; Tomoda et al. 2009). This is **below 15**.

3) **Prose Quality (no bullet points in Intro/Lit/Results/Discussion)**: **FAIL**  
- The paper uses **bullet lists** in substantive sections, including:
  - **Section 2 (Background)**: e.g., lists of states; mechanisms in **2.4** presented as bullets.
  - **Section 3 (Data and Empirical Strategy)**: bullet lists for selected states and variable definitions.
- Requirement is “complete paragraphs (not bullet points)”—this is violated.

4) **Section Completeness (each major section has 3–4 substantive paragraphs)**: **FAIL**  
- Several major sections rely heavily on lists/subsection fragments rather than **3–4 substantive paragraphs** in continuous prose. In particular:
  - **Data/Variables/Empirical Strategy (Section 3)** reads more like a structured outline with bullets than a fully developed narrative section.
  - **Conclusion (Section 6)** appears **short (≈2 paragraphs)** and does not meet the 3–4 paragraph minimum as written.

5) **Figures (all contain visible data)**: **PASS**  
- Figures shown (main estimates plot; event-study plot) visibly contain data points/intervals and labeled axes.

6) **Tables (real numbers, no placeholders)**: **PASS**  
- Tables include numeric entries with standard errors and sample sizes; no “TBD/XXX” placeholders are visible.

## PHASE 1 VERDICT

**PHASE 1: FAIL - FORMAT ISSUES**

### Format issues that must be fixed before Phase 2 content review
1) **Increase main-text length to ≥25 pages** (excluding references/appendix).  
2) **Expand bibliography to ≥15 references** (currently ~8).  
3) **Replace bullet points with full prose paragraphs** in Introduction/Literature/Results/Discussion (and elsewhere).  
4) **Ensure each major section** (Introduction, Literature/Background, Data, Methods, Results, Conclusion) has **at least 3–4 substantive paragraphs** in narrative form (not outline-style bullets).

Per your instructions, I’m **not proceeding to Phase 2** until these format requirements are satisfied.
