# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-28

## Summary

After revisions, the paper now clearly frames the analysis as a methodological demonstration of identification failure rather than an attempt to estimate treatment effects.

## Improvements Made

1. Fixed screened-out household coding (now correctly coded as food secure per USDA methodology)
2. Corrected recall window description (Dec(t-1)-Nov(t), not Jan-Dec)
3. Fixed CS table numbers (0.046, 0.057 for group-time, 0.052 aggregated)
4. Added explicit warning that estimates are "intentionally misspecified"
5. Fixed x-axis labels on figures

## Remaining Minor Issues

- Paper is 17 pages (slightly under 25-page target, but appropriate for a cautionary tale)
- Could expand Discussion section

## Recommendation

Paper is ready for external review.
