# Internal Review - Round 1

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-28

## Summary

This is a methodological cautionary tale paper that explicitly demonstrates why naive difference-in-differences cannot estimate causal effects of universal school meals policies using CPS-FSS data with limited pre-treatment periods and recall-window timing misalignment.

## Key Points

1. **Design**: The paper clearly states that its TWFE and CS estimates are "intentionally misspecified" and not interpretable as treatment effects.

2. **Timing Issues**: Correctly identifies that:
   - 2022 adopters have no pre-treatment periods in the data
   - 12-month recall window doesn't align with survey-year treatment coding
   - Federal waivers contaminate the 2022 "pre" period

3. **Statistical Reporting**: Standard errors, sample sizes, and cluster counts are properly reported.

4. **Limitations**: The paper is explicit about all limitations - this IS the main contribution.

## Recommendation

The paper is ready for external review. It is an unusual submission in that it demonstrates methodological failure rather than claiming causal estimates, but this framing is clear throughout.
