## Advisor Review Summary (PASSED)

All three advisors found no fatal errors in the paper. The methodology is sound, standard errors are properly reported, and the paper correctly uses heterogeneity-robust DiD estimators.

---

## External Review Summary

All three external reviewers recommended REJECT AND RESUBMIT, citing:

1. **Design Limitations:** State-level establishment stocks are too coarse an outcome for the "business formation" question. Reviewers want BDS births/deaths data and county-level border-pair designs.

2. **Treatment Specification:** Mismatch between continuous (log MW) and binary (above federal) treatment definitions across estimators.

3. **Literature:** While improved from 8 to 14 references, reviewers want deeper engagement with firm dynamics and local identification literatures.

---

## Revisions Made

1. Fixed treatment timing inconsistencies in appendix (13 early adopters correctly listed)
2. Corrected Florida timing discrepancy
3. Expanded literature to 14 references
4. Qualified conclusions to reflect design limitations

---

## Decision Rationale

The fundamental critiques require:
- Different data (BDS instead of CBP)
- Different geographic unit (counties instead of states)
- Different identification (border pairs)

These changes constitute a complete research redesign, not a revision.

---

## FINAL DECISION: REJECT AND RESUBMIT

The paper documents a precisely estimated null effect of state minimum wage increases on establishment stocks, using appropriate modern DiD methods. However, the research design is insufficient for broader claims about "business formation." The paper should be published as a limited contribution documenting this null finding, with clear acknowledgment of design limitations.

**Recommendation for future work:** Reframe as county-level analysis using BDS entry/exit data with border-pair identification strategy.
