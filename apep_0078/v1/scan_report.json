This is synthetic data generation (not random, but fabricated/approximated) that directly affects the deflation of minimum wages (real_mw) used in estimation. The manuscript states CPI-U deflation using standard practice, implying official CPI-U values, not an ad-hoc constructed series.: cpi_data <- tibble(\n  year = rep(2005:2023, each = 12),\n  month = rep(1:12, 19)\n) %>%\n  mutate(\n    cpi = case_when(\n      year == 2005 ~ 191.0 + (month - 1) * 0.4,\n      year == 2006 ~ 198.3 + (month - 1) * 0.3,\n      ...\n      year == 2023 ~ 299.2 + (month - 1) * 0.3,\n      TRUE ~ 260\n    )\n  )",

These variables look like 'Business Applications' series (typical Census BFS terminology) but are not fetched from any BFS source; they are synthetic proxies. This is problematic because other scripts (04_robustness.R, 06_tables.R) treat BA/HBA/WBA as real outcomes and run regressions on them.: bfs_data <- qcew_panel %>%\n  ...\n  crossing(month = 1:12) %>%\n  mutate(\n    BA = round(establishments / 12),\n    HBA = round(BA * 0.3),\n    WBA = round(BA * 0.25)\n  )",

While the manuscript says minimum wage data are compiled from DOL and state records (which can justify manual compilation), the code provides no citations, checks, or reproducible provenance for these values, and the table is incomplete (only a subset of states appear). This materially affects treatment assignment and real MW levels.: state_mw_changes <- tribble(\n  ~state_abbr, ~effective_date, ~state_mw,\n  # California\n  \"CA\", \"2004-01-01\", 6.75, \"CA\", \"2007-01-01\", 7.50, ...\n  ...\n)",

This makes the analysis outcome approximately 1/12 of the true annual establishment count. The manuscript claims CBP annual establishment counts at the state-year level; this implementation does not match that description and changes the scale/interpretation of the dependent variable.: bfs_annual <- bfs_data %>%\n  group_by(state_abbr, state_fips, year) %>%\n  summarize(\n    establishments = max(BA, na.rm = TRUE),  # Annual establishment count\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )",

This suggests the codebase may be partially repurposed from a different project, risking inconsistent reporting and confusion about what outcomes were actually analyzed.: summary_outcomes <- analysis_panel %>%\n  summarize(\n    `Business Applications` = mean(BA, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `High-Propensity Applications` = mean(HBA, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Applications w/ Planned Wages` = mean(WBA, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )",

This mismatch undermines the traceability of robustness claims in the paper (e.g., placebo tests, alternative FE) to the stated empirical design.: placebo_continuous <- feols(\n  log_BA ~ log_real_mw_lead12 | state_fe + ym_fe,\n  data = placebo_data,\n  cluster = ~state_abbr\n)",

It also manufactures additional outcome variables (BA/HBA/WBA) as deterministic fractions of establishment counts and converts annual figures to monthly by mechanically repeating them across 12 months, creating synthetic time-series variation. Minimum-wage values are embedded in an incomplete state change table, and any unmatched state-month is defaulted to the federal minimum wage, which can systematically misstate state policies and bias results.",
