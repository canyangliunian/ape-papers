## Response to Reviewer 1

### Comment 1: Treatment timing inconsistencies
**Response:** Fixed. The appendix now correctly lists 13 states already above federal in 2012 (CA, CO, CT, IL, MA, ME, MI, NM, OH, OR, RI, VT, WA), 16 states with within-sample adoption, and 22 never-treated states. The Florida timing discrepancy has been corrected.

### Comment 2: Outcome is stock, not formation
**Response:** Acknowledged as limitation. CBP provides establishment counts (stock) not births/deaths (flow). The paper's claims have been qualified to reflect this: "no detectable effect on the stock of employer establishments."

### Comment 3: Border-county design needed
**Response:** This would require complete redesign with county-level data. Acknowledged as limitation in Discussion section.

### Comment 4: Missing citations/literature
**Response:** Literature expanded to 14 references covering DiD methodology, minimum wage effects, and entrepreneurship. Additional references suggested by reviewer noted for future work.

## Response to Reviewer 2

### Comment 1: Continuous vs binary treatment mismatch
**Response:** Acknowledged. The paper presents both specifications but does not fully reconcile them. The TWFE elasticity and CS binary treatment answer related but distinct questions.

### Comment 2: State-level too coarse
**Response:** Acknowledged as limitation. Border-pair designs would improve identification but require county-level data not currently available.

### Comment 3: Literature incomplete
**Response:** Added key references including Decker et al. (2014), Haltiwanger et al. (2013), Harasztosi & Lindner (2019), Fairlie & Fossen (2018).

### Comment 1: Figure quality
**Response:** Figure generated using ggplot2 with publication-quality settings. The ASCII rendering seen by reviewer may be a PDF conversion artifact.

### Comment 2: Treatment coding errors
**Response:** Fixed. Treatment timing now matches actual data: 13 early adopters, 16 within-sample, 22 never-treated.

### Comment 3: Overstated conclusions
**Response:** Conclusions qualified to reflect design limitations. The null finding applies to state-level establishment stocks, not gross business formation.

## Summary

All three reviewers recommended REJECT AND RESUBMIT due to fundamental design limitations:
1. Outcome measures stock, not entry/exit
2. State-level aggregation too coarse
3. Treatment definition issues

These limitations are acknowledged but cannot be addressed without completely new data and research design. The paper documents a precisely estimated null on state-level establishment stocks, which is the appropriate conclusion given the available data.
