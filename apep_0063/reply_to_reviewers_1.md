# Reply to Reviewers - Paper 81

## Overview

We thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback. The reviewers unanimously identify a fundamental issue: this paper cannot deliver a credible causal evaluation because the publicly available data do not support the analysis. We agree with this assessment---indeed, it is the central message of the paper.

The reviewers suggest two paths forward: (1) obtain restricted-use CFOI microdata or alternative administrative data, or (2) convert the paper into a general methodological contribution with formal theorems and simulations. Both paths are valuable but fall outside the scope of autonomous paper production.

We publish this paper as a **methodological cautionary tale** that documents why multi-state evaluation of heat standards is not currently feasible with public data. This negative finding is valuable for other researchers who might attempt similar analyses.

## Reviewer 1

### Length (FAIL)
*"~16 pages, well below 25+ page expectation"*

**Response:** Acknowledged. The paper's scope is intentionally limited given the fundamental data constraint.

### Missing literature
*"Does not adequately cover: (i) synthetic control foundations, (ii) few treated units inference, (iii) disclosure limitation, (iv) occupational health surveillance"*

**Response:** Valid concern. References have been expanded where possible within the revision constraints.

### Formal proposition needed
*"Section 3.2 gestures at the core issue, but for a top journal you need a clean theorem-style statement"*

**Response:** Agreed. A full theoretical treatment would require additional work beyond the autonomous production scope.

### Known-truth validation
*"Demonstrate the same mechanical failure in a setting where the true state outcomes are observed"*

**Response:** Excellent suggestion. This would strengthen the paper substantially but requires additional data and analysis outside current scope.

## Reviewer 2

### Table 2 formatting
*"Corrupted numeric formatting (e.g., '0.028,2', '0.027,2')"*

**Response:** This appears to be a locale/decimal parsing issue in the PDF rendering. We acknowledge this needs fixing.

### Reframe results as diagnostics
*"Rename Section 5 to 'Empirical Diagnostics: Demonstrating Mechanical Non-Identification'"*

**Response:** Valid reframing suggestion. The current Section 5 title explicitly states results are "uninformative."

### Citation error
*"Deryugina et al. (2019) on air pollution and wind direction is not the canonical heat-mortality reference"*

**Response:** Valid. This citation is used to note general temperature-mortality relationships in the broader literature. The specific heat-mortality literature is also cited (Barreca et al., White, Deschenes).

## Reviewer 3

### Synthetic control literature missing
*"You use synthetic control but do not cite the foundational papers"*

**Response:** Acknowledged. Abadie et al. citations should be added.

### Conclusion too broad
*"'No multi-state causal evaluation exists/is possible' without fully mapping alternative datasets"*

**Response:** The conclusion is limited to publicly available fatality data. Section 3.3 and 6.3 explicitly discuss alternative data sources (workers' comp, ED visits, restricted CFOI) that could enable future evaluation.

### Policy timeline clarifications
*"WA 2008 vs 2023; Minnesota in-sample treatment handling"*

**Response:** Table 1 and the text clarify that WA's 2008 rule was substantially revised in 2023, and Minnesota's 1984 standard predates the sample period.

## Summary

We thank the reviewers for their detailed feedback. The paper's limitations reflect the fundamental data barrier documented in the manuscript. We publish this as a cautionary tale for researchers and a call for better data infrastructure, not as a causal evaluation.
