## Response to GPT-5-mini

### Re: Missing 95% Confidence Intervals
We have added explicit 95% CIs to the main results tables. We agree this improves interpretability.

### Re: Pre-2012 Placebo Tests
We appreciate this suggestion. Unfortunately, our technology vintage data begins in 2010, so we cannot construct the technology measure for 2007 (which would be needed for a 2008 election analysis with lagged technology). We have added an explicit note explaining this data limitation. The 2012 election (Romney vs. Obama) serves as our pre-Trump baseline, showing that technology age had no predictive power for Republican support before Trump's emergence.

### Re: Migration/Composition Data
This is a valuable suggestion for future research. Adding IRS migration flows would require substantial additional data work beyond the scope of this revision. We acknowledge this limitation in the Discussion section.

### Re: Missing Literature
We have added citations to Sun & Abraham (2021) and de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020) and note that our panel correlation approach does not suffer from the staggered-DiD biases they identify.

## Response to Grok-4.1-Fast

### Re: Missing 95% Confidence Intervals
Addressed - we have added explicit 95% CIs to the main tables.

### Re: Under-engagement with Methodology Literature
We have added discussion of why our fixed effects approach avoids TWFE pitfalls (we do not have staggered treatment timing) and cite the relevant methodological papers.

## Response to Gemini-3-Flash

We thank the reviewer for the "CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT" recommendation and the constructive suggestions.

### Re: 2008 Data
As noted above, technology data begins in 2010, precluding analysis of the 2008 election. We have clarified this limitation.

### Re: Horse Race with China Shock
An excellent suggestion for future work. Incorporating the Autor et al. trade shock measure would require additional data merging and is beyond the scope of this revision. We note this as a direction for future research.

### Re: 2024 Selling Point
We have added emphasis in the abstract and introduction noting that even with the brand-new 2024 data, the sorting pattern holds.

3. Added missing methodology citations
4. Enhanced emphasis on 2024 findings
5. Minor prose improvements based on reviewer suggestions
