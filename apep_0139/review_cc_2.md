## Follow-up Review

After the first round of internal review, several inconsistencies were fixed:
- Discussion section updated to reflect null results
- Cost-effectiveness calculations revised
- Sample size descriptions made consistent
- Reference year inconsistencies fixed

## Remaining Minor Issues

1. Figure annotations may not exactly match table values (cosmetic)
2. UHF codes could be added to weight table
3. Standard error for East Harlem ATT could be added

These are minor and do not affect the core findings.

## Assessment

The paper now correctly reports an honest null finding. The methodology is sound, the limitations are acknowledged, and the contribution is clear: proper SCM methodology reveals that the previously claimed large effects were artifacts of methodological choices, not genuine treatment effects.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
