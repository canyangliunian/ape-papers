# Idea Ranking

## Summary

This is a revision of apep_0136. The ranking focuses on the appropriateness of the methodological fix rather than novelty of the research question.

## Rankings

### Idea 1: Effect of NYC OPCs on Overdose Mortality

**Recommendation:** PURSUE

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Novelty | 8 | 40% | 3.2 |
| Identification | 7 | 30% | 2.1 |
| Feasibility | 9 | 20% | 1.8 |
| Relevance | 9 | 10% | 0.9 |
| **Overall** | | | **8.0** |

**Rationale:** The methodological fix (de-meaned SCM per Ferman & Pinto 2021) correctly addresses the level mismatch problem that invalidated the original analysis. The results are likely to be null (which is what we found), but honest null results are valuable scientific contributions.

**Key Concerns:**
- Small sample size (7 units) limits power
- Short post-treatment period (3 years)
- Results contradict prior claims but are methodologically sound

## Decision

Proceed with methodological revision. Report honest results regardless of outcome.
